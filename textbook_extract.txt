                                                                                1st number        Multiplier
                                                                                           2nd number            Tolerance band (e.g. gold = 5%
                                                                                                                   silver = 10%, none = 20%)



                             1. Write down the numeric value corresponding to the first band on the left.
                             2. Write down the numeric value corresponding to the second band from the left.
                             3. Write down the number of zeros indicated by the multiplier band, which represents a power of 10
                                (black = no extra zeros, brown = 1 zero, etc.). A gold multiplier band indicates that the decimal
                                is shifted one place to the left; a silver multiplier band indicates that the decimal is shifted
                                two places to the left.
                             4. The tolerance band represents the precision. So, for example, we would not be surprised to find a 100 
                                5 percent tolerance resistor that measures anywhere in the range of 95 to 105 .


                           Example
                           Red Red Orange Gold                    = 22,000       or 22 × 103            = 22 k, 5% tolerance
                           Blue Gray Gold                         = 6.8          or 68 × 10−1           = 6.8 , 20% tolerance

WILLIAM H. HAYT, Jr., received his B.S. and M.S. at Purdue University
and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. After spending four years in
industry, Professor Hayt joined the faculty of Purdue University, where he
served as Professor and Head of the School of Electrical Engineering, and
as Professor Emeritus after retiring in 1986. Besides Engineering Circuit
Analysis, Professor Hayt authored three other texts, including Engineering
Electromagnetics, now in its eighth edition with McGraw-Hill. Professor
Hayt’s professional society memberships included Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta
Pi, Sigma Xi, Sigma Delta Chi, Fellow of IEEE, ASEE, and NAEB. While
at Purdue, he received numerous teaching awards, including the univer-
sity’s Best Teacher Award. He is also listed in Purdue’s Book of Great
Teachers, a permanent wall display in the Purdue Memorial Union, dedi-
cated on April 23, 1999. The book bears the names of the inaugural group
of 225 faculty members, past and present, who have devoted their lives to
excellence in teaching and scholarship. They were chosen by their students
and their peers as Purdue’s finest educators.
JACK E. KEMMERLY received his B.S. magna cum laude from The Catholic
University of America, M.S. from University of Denver, and Ph.D. from
Purdue University. Professor Kemmerly first taught at Purdue University
and later worked as principal engineer at the Aeronutronic Division of Ford
Motor Company. He then joined California State University, Fullerton,
where he served as Professor, Chairman of the Faculty of Electrical Engi-
neering, Chairman of the Engineering Division, and Professor Emeritus.
Professor Kemmerly’s professional society memberships included Eta
Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, ASEE, and IEEE (Senior Member). His
pursuits outside of academe included being an officer in the Little League
and a scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts.
STEVEN M. DURBIN received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical
Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. Subsequently, he
was with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Florida State University
and Florida A&M University before joining the University of Canterbury, New
Zealand, in 2000. SinceAugust 2010, he has been with the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York, where he holds a joint appointment between
the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Physics. His teaching interests
include circuits, electronics, electromagnetics, solid-state electronics and
nanotechnology. His research interests are primarily concerned with the
development of new semiconductor materials—in particular those based on ox-
ide and nitride compounds—as well as novel optoelectronic device structures.
HeisafoundingprincipalinvestigatoroftheMacDiarmidInstituteforAdvanced
Materials and Nanotechnology, a New Zealand National Centre of Research
Excellence, and coauthor of over 100 technical publications. He is a senior mem-
ber of the IEEE, and a member of Eta Kappa Nu, the Electron Devices Society,

        he target audience colors everything about a book, being a major fac-
        tor in decisions big and small, particularly both the pace and the
        overall writing style. Consequently it is important to note that the au-
thors have made the conscious decision to write this book to the student,
and not to the instructor. Our underlying philosophy is that reading the book
should be enjoyable, despite the level of technical detail that it must incor-
porate. When we look back to the very first edition of Engineering Circuit
Analysis, it’s clear that it was developed specifically to be more of a con-
versation than a dry, dull discourse on a prescribed set of fundamental top-
ics. To keep it conversational, we’ve had to work hard at updating the book
so that it continues to speak to the increasingly diverse group of students
using it all over the world.
    Although in many engineering programs the introductory circuits course
is preceded or accompanied by an introductory physics course in which
electricity and magnetism are introduced (typically from a fields perspec-
tive), this is not required to use this book. After finishing the course, many
students find themselves truly amazed that such a broad set of analytical
tools have been derived from only three simple scientific laws—Ohm’s
law and Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws. The first six chapters assume
only a familiarity with algebra and simultaneous equations; subsequent
chapters assume a first course in calculus (derivatives and integrals) is being
taken in tandem. Beyond that, we have tried to incorporate sufficient details
to allow the book to be read on its own.
    So, what key features have been designed into this book with the student
in mind? First, individual chapters are organized into relatively short sub-
sections, each having a single primary topic. The language has been up-
dated to remain informal and to flow smoothly. Color is used to highlight
important information as opposed to merely improve the aesthetics of the
page layout, and white space is provided for jotting down short notes and
questions. New terms are defined as they are introduced, and examples are
placed strategically to demonstrate not only basic concepts, but problem-
solving approaches as well. Practice problems relevant to the examples are
placed in proximity so that students can try out the techniques for them-
selves before attempting the end-of-chapter exercises. The exercises repre-
sent a broad range of difficulties, generally ordered from simpler to more
complex, and grouped according to the relevant section of each chapter.
Answers to selected odd-numbered end-of-chapter exercises are posted on
the book’s website at www.mhhe.com/haytdurbin8e.
    Engineering is an intensive subject to study, and students often find them-
selves faced with deadlines and serious workloads. This does not mean that
textbooks have to be dry and pompous, however, or that coursework should
never contain any element of fun. In fact, successfully solving a problem of-
ten is fun, and learning how to do that can be fun as well. Determining how

                                                                                             xv

      to best accomplish this within the context of a textbook is an ongoing
      process. The authors have always relied on the often very candid feedback
      received from our own students at Purdue University; the California State
      University, Fullerton; Fort Lewis College in Durango, the joint engineering
      program at Florida A&M University and Florida State University, the Uni-
      versity of Canterbury (New Zealand) and the University at Buffalo. We also
      rely on comments, corrections, and suggestions from instructors and students
      worldwide, and for this edition, consideration has been given to a new source
      of comments, namely, semianonymous postings on various websites.
          The first edition of Engineering Circuit Analysis was written by Bill
      Hayt and Jack Kemmerly, two engineering professors who very much en-
      joyed teaching, interacting with their students, and training generations of
      future engineers. It was well received due to its compact structure, “to the
      point” informal writing style, and logical organization. There is no timidity
      when it comes to presenting the theory underlying a specific topic, or
      pulling punches when developing mathematical expressions. Everything,
      however, was carefully designed to assist students in their learning, present
      things in a straightforward fashion, and leave theory for theory’s sake to
      other books. They clearly put a great deal of thought into writing the book,
      and their enthusiasm for the subject comes across to the reader.


      KEY FEATURES OF THE EIGHTH EDITION
                                                                 •
      We have taken great care to retain key features from the seventh edition
      which were clearly working well. These include the general layout and se-
      quence of chapters, the basic style of both the text and line drawings, the use
      of four-color printing where appropriate, numerous worked examples and
      related practice problems, and grouping of end-of-chapter exercises accord-
      ing to section. Transformers continue to merit their own chapter, and com-
      plex frequency is briefly introduced through a student-friendly extension of
      the phasor technique, instead of indirectly by merely stating the Laplace
      transform integral. We also have retained the use of icons, an idea first in-
      troduced in the sixth edition:

                 Provides a heads-up to common mistakes;


                 Indicates a point that’s worth noting;


                 Denotes a design problem to which there is no unique answer;


                 Indicates a problem which requires computer-aided analysis.

      The introduction of engineering-oriented analysis and design software in
      the book has been done with the mind-set that it should assist, not replace,
      the learning process. Consequently, the computer icon denotes problems
      that are typically phrased such that the software is used to verify answers,
      and not simply provide them. Both MATLAB® and PSpice® are used in this

SPECIFIC CHANGES FOR THE EIGHTH EDITION
INCLUDE:
•   A new section in Chapter 16 on the analysis and design of multistage
    Butterworth filters
•   Over 1000 new and revised end-of-chapter exercises
•   A new overarching philosophy on end-of-chapter exercises, with each
    section containing problems similar to those solved in worked
    examples and practice problems, before proceeding to more complex
    problems to test the reader’s skills
•   Introduction of Chapter-Integrating Exercises at the end of each
    chapter. For the convenience of instructors and students, end-of-
    chapter exercises are grouped by section. To provide the opportunity
    for assigning exercises with less emphasis on an explicit solution
    method (for example, mesh or nodal analysis), as well as to give a
    broader perspective on key topics within each chapter, a select number
    of Chapter-Integrating Exercises appear at the end of each chapter.
•   New photos, many in full color, to provide connection to the real world
•   Updated screen captures and text descriptions of computer-aided
    analysis software
•   New worked examples and practice problems
•   Updates to the Practical Application feature, introduced to help
    students connect material in each chapter to broader concepts in
    engineering. Topics include distortion in amplifiers, modeling
    automotive suspension systems, practical aspects of grounding, the
    relationship of poles to stability, resistivity, and the memristor,
    sometimes called “the missing element”
•   Streamlining of text, especially in the worked examples, to get to the
    point faster
•   Answers to selected odd-numbered end-of-chapter exercises are posted
    on the book’s website at www.mhhe.com/haytdurbin8e.
    I joined the book in 1999, and sadly never had the opportunity to speak
to either Bill or Jack about the revision process, although I count myself
lucky to have taken a circuits course from Bill Hayt while I was a student at
Purdue. It is a distinct privilege to serve as a coauthor to Engineering
Circuit Analysis, and in working on this book I give its fundamental philos-
ophy and target audience the highest priority. I greatly appreciate the many
people who have already provided feedback—both positive and negative—
on aspects of previous editions, and welcome others to do so as well, either
through the publishers (McGraw-Hill Higher Education) or to me directly
(durbin@ieee.org).
    Of course, this project has been a team effort, as is the case with every
modern textbook. In particular I would like to thank Raghu Srinivasan
(Global Publisher), Peter Massar (Sponsoring Editor), Curt Reynolds (Mar-
keting Manager), Jane Mohr (Project Manager), Brittney-Corrigan-
McElroy (Project Manager), Brenda Rolwes (Designer), Tammy Juran
(Media Project Manager), and most importantly, Developmental Editor
Darlene Schueller, who helped me with many, many details, issues, deadlines,

        support from the team at McGraw-Hill. I would also like to thank various
        McGraw-Hill representatives, especially Nazier Hassan, who dropped by
        whenever on campus to just say hello and ask how things were going. Spe-
        cial thanks are also due to Catherine Shultz and Michael Hackett, former
        editors who continue to keep in contact. Cadence® and The MathWorks
        kindly provided assistance with software-aided analysis software, which
        was much appreciated. Several colleagues have generously supplied or
        helped with photographs and technical details, for which I’m very grateful:

          many reasons for this, but one of the best is that in today’s world         Use of Engineering Software
          it’s extremely unlikely for any engineer to encounter a system that
          does not in some way include electrical circuitry. As circuits be-          A Problem-Solving Strategy
          come smaller and require less power, and power sources become
          smaller and cheaper, embedded circuits are seemingly everywhere.
          Since most engineering situations require a team effort at some
          stage, having a working knowledge of circuit analysis therefore
          helps to provide everyone on a project with the background needed
          for effective communication.
               Consequently, this book is not just about “circuit analysis” from
          an engineering perspective, but is also about developing basic
          problem-solving skills as they apply to situations an engineer is
          likely to encounter. As part of this, we also find that we’re develop-
          ing an intuitive understanding at a general level, and often we can

Not all electrical engineers routinely make use of circuit
analysis, but they often bring to bear analytical and
problem-solving skills learned early on in their careers.
A circuit analysis course is one of the first exposures to
such concepts. (Solar Mirrors: © Corbis; Skyline: © Getty

                                                             difference between analysis and design, and the evolving role computer

                                                             Sure! We encounter nonlinear circuits every day: they capture and decode
                                                             signals for our TVs and radios, perform calculations millions of times a

linear fashion over a limited range—allowing us to model them as linear
systems if we keep the range limitations in mind.
    For example, consider the common function
                                                f (x) = e x
   A linear approximation to this function is
                                               f (x) ≈ 1 + x
    Let’s test this out. Table 1.1 shows both the exact value and the approx-
imate value of f (x) for a range of x. Interestingly, the linear approximation
is exceptionally accurate up to about x = 0.1, when the relative error is still
less than 1%. Although many engineers are rather quick on a calculator, it’s
hard to argue that any approach is faster than just adding 1.

    Linear problems are inherently more easily solved than their nonlinear
counterparts. For this reason, we often seek reasonably accurate linear ap-
proximations (or models) to physical situations. Furthermore, the linear
models are more easily manipulated and understood—making design a
more straightforward process.
    The circuits we will encounter in subsequent chapters all represent linear
approximations to physical electric circuits. Where appropriate, brief discus-
sions of potential inaccuracies or limitations to these models are provided, but
generally speaking we find them to be suitably accurate for most applications.
When greater accuracy is required in practice, nonlinear models are em-
ployed, but with a considerable increase in solution complexity. A detailed dis-
cussion of what constitutes a linear electric circuit can be found in Chap. 2.
    Linear circuit analysis can be separated into four broad categories: (1)
dc analysis, where the energy sources do not change with time; (2) transient
analysis, where things often change quickly; (3) sinusoidal analysis, which
applies to both ac power and signals; and (4) frequency response, which is
the most general of the four categories, but typically assumes something is
changing with time. We begin our journey with the topic of resistive cir-
cuits, which may include simple examples such as a flashlight or a toaster.
This provides us with a perfect opportunity to learn a number of very pow-
erful engineering circuit analysis techniques, such as nodal analysis, mesh
analysis, superposition, source transformation, Thévenin’s theorem, Norton’s

                                                          circuits is that the time dependence of any quantity of interest does not

equations we develop to describe the behavior of various circuits. We simply
need to learn how to “translate” the relevant variables (for example, replacing
voltage with force, charge with distance, resistance with friction coefficient,
etc.) to find that we already know how to work a new type of problem. Very
often, if we have previous experience in solving a similar or related problem,
our intuition can guide us through the solution of a totally new problem.
    What we are about to learn regarding linear circuit analysis forms the
basis for many subsequent electrical engineering courses. The study of elec-
tronics relies on the analysis of circuits with devices known as diodes and
transistors, which are used to construct power supplies, amplifiers, and dig-
ital circuits. The skills which we will develop are typically applied in a
rapid, methodical fashion by electronics engineers, who sometimes can
analyze a complicated circuit without even reaching for a pencil! The
time-domain and frequency-domain chapters of this text lead directly into
discussions of signal processing, power transmission, control theory, and
communications. We find that frequency-domain analysis in particular is
an extremely powerful technique, easily applied to any physical system
subjected to time-varying excitation, and particularly helpful in the design
of filters.

bine this with practical knowledge often expressed in mathematical terms,
and (frequently with considerable creativity) arrive at a solution to a given
problem. Analysis is the process through which we determine the scope of
a problem, obtain the information required to understand it, and compute
the parameters of interest. Design is the process by which we synthesize
something new as part of the solution to a problem. Generally speaking,
there is an expectation that a problem requiring design will have no unique
solution, whereas the analysis phase typically will. Thus, the last step in
designing is always analyzing the result to see if it meets specifications.

interest that describe the operation of the circuit. Once the engineer is satis-
fied with the simulated performance of the design, the same software can
generate the printed circuit board layout using geometrical parameters in
the components library. This level of integration is continually increasing,
to the point where soon an engineer will be able to draw a schematic, click
a few buttons, and walk to the other side of the table to pick up a manufac-
tured version of the circuit, ready to test!
    The reader should be wary, however, of one thing. Circuit analysis soft-
ware, although fun to use, is by no means a replacement for good old-
fashioned paper-and-pencil analysis. We need to have a solid understanding of
how circuits work in order to develop an ability to design them. Simply going
through the motions of running a particular software package is a little like
playing the lottery: with user-generated entry errors, hidden default parame-
ters in the myriad of menu choices, and the occasional shortcoming of human-
written code, there is no substitute for having at least an approximate idea of
the expected behavior of a circuit. Then, if the simulation result does not agree
with expectations, we can find the error early, rather than after it’s too late.
    Still, computer-aided analysis is a powerful tool. It allows us to vary pa-
rameter values and evaluate the change in circuit performance, and to con-
sider several variations to a design in a straightforward manner. The result
is a reduction of repetitive tasks, and more time to concentrate on engineer-
ing details.

so just at this moment, those skills are not yet fully developed. As you proceed

          INTRODUCTION                                                             and Associated Units:
          In conducting circuit analysis, we often find ourselves seeking spe-     Charge, Current, Voltage,
          cific currents, voltages, or powers, so here we begin with a brief de-   and Power
          scription of these quantities. In terms of components that can be
          used to build electrical circuits, we have quite a few from which to     Current Direction and
          choose. We initially focus on the resistor, a simple passive compo-      Voltage Polarity
          nent, and a range of idealized active sources of voltage and current.
          As we move forward, new components will be added to the inven-           The Passive Sign Convention

          tory to allow more complex (and useful) circuits to be considered.
              A quick word of advice before we begin: Pay close attention to
                                                                                   Ideal Voltage and Current
          the role of “+” and “−” signs when labeling voltages, and the sig-

          In order to state the value of some measurable quantity, we must
          give both a number and a unit, such as “3 meters.” Fortunately, we
          all use the same number system. This is not true for units, and a lit-
          tle time must be spent in becoming familiar with a suitable system.
          We must agree on a standard unit and be assured of its permanence
          and its general acceptability. The standard unit of length, for exam-
          ple, should not be defined in terms of the distance between two
          marks on a certain rubber band; this is not permanent, and further-
          more everybody else is using another standard.
              The most frequently used system of units is the one adopted by
          the National Bureau of Standards in 1964; it is used by all major
          professional engineering societies and is the language in which to-
          day’s textbooks are written. This is the International System of
          Units (abbreviated SI in all languages), adopted by the General

    These prefixes are worth memorizing, for they will appear often both in
this text and in other technical work. Combinations of several prefixes, such
as the millimicrosecond, are unacceptable. It is worth noting that in terms
of distance, it is common to see “micron (μm)” as opposed to “microme-
ter,” and often the angstrom (Å) is used for 10−10 meter. Also, in circuit
analysis and engineering in general, it is fairly common to see numbers ex-
pressed in what are frequently termed “engineering units.” In engineering
notation, a quantity is represented by a number between 1 and 999 and an
appropriate metric unit using a power divisible by 3. So, for example, it is
preferable to express the quantity 0.048 W as 48 mW, instead of 4.8 cW,
4.8 × 10−2 W, or 48,000 μW.

charge conservation. We know from basic physics that there are two types

                                                                A quantity of charge that does not change with time is typically repre-

                                                            time-invariant) is commonly represented by q(t), or simply q. This conven-

                                                            for constant (time-invariant) quantities, whereas lowercase letters represent
                                                            the more general case. Thus, a constant charge may be represented by either
                                                            Q or q, but an amount of charge that changes over time must be represented
                                                            by the lowercase letter q.

by Fig. 2.4a. We will find many practical examples of currents that vary si-

household circuits. Such a current is often referred to as alternating current,                                                                      t

the physical nature of conduction only part of the time. The definition and
symbolism we have adopted are standard.
    It is essential that we realize that the current arrow does not indicate the
“actual” direction of current flow but is simply part of a convention that
allows us to talk about “the current in the wire” in an unambiguous manner.
The arrow is a fundamental part of the definition of a current! Thus, to talk
about the value of a current i 1 (t) without specifying the arrow is to discuss
an undefined entity. For example, Fig. 2.6a and b are meaningless represen-                                 3A                      –3 A

Power
We have already defined power, and we will represent it by P or p. If one
joule of energy is expended in transferring one coulomb of charge through
the device in one second, then the rate of energy transfer is one watt. The
absorbed power must be proportional both to the number of coulombs trans-
ferred per second (current) and to the energy needed to transfer one
                                                                                                      i
coulomb through the element (voltage). Thus,

Dimensionally, the right side of this equation is the product of joules per                    –
coulomb and coulombs per second, which produces the expected dimension
of joules per second, or watts. The conventions for current, voltage, and
power are shown in Fig. 2.12.

ergy is expended. However, no statement can be made concerning energy
transfer in any of the four cases shown in Fig. 2.9, for example, until the
direction of the current is specified. Let us imagine that a current arrow is
placed alongside each upper lead, directed to the right, and labeled “+2 A.”
First, consider the case shown in Fig. 2.9c. Terminal A is 5 V positive with
respect to terminal B, which means that 5 J of energy is required to move
each coulomb of positive charge into terminal A, through the object, and out
terminal B. Since we are injecting +2 A (a current of 2 coulombs of positive
charge per second) into terminal A, we are doing (5 J/C) × (2 C/s)  10 J of
work per second on the object. In other words, the object is absorbing 10 W
of power from whatever is injecting the current.
    We know from an earlier discussion that there is no difference between
Fig. 2.9c and Fig. 2.9d, so we expect the object depicted in Fig. 2.9d to also
be absorbing 10 W. We can check this easily enough: we are injecting +2 A
into terminal A of the object, so +2 A flows out of terminal B. Another way
of saying this is that we are injecting −2 A of current into terminal B. It
takes −5 J/C to move charge from terminal B to terminal A, so the object is
absorbing (−5 J/C) × (−2 C/s)  +10 W as expected. The only difficulty
in describing this particular case is keeping the minus signs straight, but
with a bit of care we see the correct answer can be obtained regardless of
our choice of positive reference terminal (terminal A in Fig. 2.9c, and
terminal B in Fig. 2.9d).

                                                                 second through the 2 A current flowing into terminal A. The object is actu-

                                                                 (i.e., 10 W) to some other object not shown in the figure. Negative absorbed

                                                                      Let’s recap. Figure 2.12 shows that if one terminal of the element is v volts
                                                                 positive with respect to the other terminal, and if a current i is entering the

 In Fig. 2.13a, we see that the reference current is defined consistent
 with the passive sign convention, which assumes that the element is
 absorbing power. With +3 A flowing into the positive reference termi-
 nal, we compute
                              P = (2 V)(3 A) = 6 W
 of power absorbed by the element.
    Figure 2.13b shows a slightly different picture. Now, we have a cur-
 rent of −3 A flowing into the positive reference terminal. This gives us
 an absorbed power
                            P = (−2 V)(−3 A) = 6 W
    Thus, we see that the two cases are actually equivalent: A current
 of +3 A flowing into the top terminal is the same as a current of +3 A
 flowing out of the bottom terminal, or, equivalently, a current of −3 A
 flowing into the bottom terminal.
    Referring to Fig. 2.13c, we again apply the passive sign convention
 rules and compute an absorbed power
                            P = (4 V)(−5 A) = −20 W
    Since we computed a negative absorbed power, this tells us that the
 element in Fig. 2.13c is actually supplying +20 W (i.e., it’s a source of
 energy).

2.3       VOLTAGE AND CURRENT SOURCES
      •
Using the concepts of current and voltage, it is now possible to be more spe-
cific in defining a circuit element.
    In so doing, it is important to differentiate between the physical device
itself and the mathematical model which we will use to analyze its behavior
in a circuit. The model is only an approximation.

ness, the symbol for an independent ac voltage source is shown in Fig. 2.16c.

Independent Current Sources
Another ideal source which we will need is the independent current
source. Here, the current through the element is completely independent of
the voltage across it. The symbol for an independent current source is                                    is
shown in Fig. 2.17. If i s is constant, we call the source an independent dc
current source. An ac current source is often drawn with a tilde through the
arrow, similar to the ac voltage source shown in Fig. 2.16c.                          ■ FIGURE 2.17 Circuit symbol for the independent

at best a reasonable approximation for a physical element. In theory it can
deliver infinite power from its terminals because it produces the same finite
current for any voltage across it, no matter how large that voltage may be. It
is, however, a good approximation for many practical sources, particularly
in electronic circuits.
    Although most students seem happy enough with an independent volt-
age source providing a fixed voltage but essentially any current, it is a com-
mon mistake to view an independent current source as having zero voltage
across its terminals while providing a fixed current. In fact, we do not know
a priori what the voltage across a current source will be—it depends entirely
on the circuit to which it is connected.

Dependent Sources
The two types of ideal sources that we have discussed up to now are called
independent sources because the value of the source quantity is not affected
in any way by activities in the remainder of the circuit. This is in contrast
with yet another kind of ideal source, the dependent, or controlled, source,
in which the source quantity is determined by a voltage or current existing                                                   +           rix    +

    Dependent and independent voltage and current sources are active ele-
ments; they are capable of delivering power to some external device. For
the present we will think of a passive element as one which is capable only
of receiving power. However, we will later see that several passive elements
are able to store finite amounts of energy and then return that energy later to
various external devices; since we still wish to call such elements passive, it
will be necessary to improve upon our two definitions a little later.


Networks and Circuits
The interconnection of two or more simple circuit elements forms an elec-
trical network. If the network contains at least one closed path, it is also an
electric circuit. Note: Every circuit is a network, but not all networks are
circuits (see Fig. 2.21)!

    A network that contains at least one active element, such as an indepen-
dent voltage or current source, is an active network. A network that does not
contain any active elements is a passive network.
    We have now defined what we mean by the term circuit element, and
we have presented the definitions of several specific circuit elements, the
independent and dependent voltage and current sources. Throughout the
remainder of the book we will define only five additional circuit elements:
the resistor, inductor, capacitor, transformer, and the ideal operational ampli-
fier (“op amp,” for short). These are all ideal elements. They are important
because we may combine them into networks and circuits that represent real
devices as accurately as we require. Thus, the transistor shown in Fig. 2.22a
and b may be modeled by the voltage terminals designated vgs and the single
dependent current source of Fig. 2.22c. Note that the dependent current
source produces a current that depends on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit.
The parameter gm , commonly referred to as the transconductance, is
calculated using transistor-specific details as well as the operating point de-
termined by the circuit connected to the transistor. It is generally a small
number, on the order of 10−2 to perhaps 10 A/V. This model works pretty well
as long as the frequency of any sinusoidal source is neither very large nor
very small; the model can be modified to account for frequency-dependent

linear resistor as simply a resistor; any resistor that is nonlinear will always
be described as such. Nonlinear resistors should not necessarily be consid-
ered undesirable elements. Although it is true that their presence compli-
cates an analysis, the performance of the device may depend on or be greatly
improved by the nonlinearity. For example, fuses for overcurrent protection
and Zener diodes for voltage regulation are very nonlinear in nature, a fact
that is exploited when using them in circuit design.


Power Absorption
Figure 2.24 shows several different resistor packages, as well as the most
common circuit symbol used for a resistor. In accordance with the voltage,
current, and power conventions already adopted, the product of v and i
gives the power absorbed by the resistor. That is, v and i are selected to
satisfy the passive sign convention. The absorbed power appears physically

                          One of the authors (who shall remain anonymous) had the unfortunate
                      experience of inadvertently connecting a 100 , 2 W carbon resistor across
                      a 110 V source. The ensuing flame, smoke, and fragmentation were rather
                      disconcerting, demonstrating clearly that a practical resistor has definite
                      limits to its ability to behave like the ideal linear model. In this case, the un-
                      fortunate resistor was called upon to absorb 121 W; since it was designed to
                      handle only 2 W, its reaction was understandably violent.

 EXAMPLE 2.3
                       The 560  resistor shown in Fig. 2.24b is connected to a circuit
                       which causes a current of 42.4 mA to flow through it. Calculate the
                       voltage across the resistor and the power it is dissipating.
                       The voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm’s law:
                                            v = Ri = (560)(0.0424) = 23.7 V
                       The dissipated power can be calculated in several different ways. For
                       instance,
                                           p = vi = (23.7)(0.0424) = 1.005 W
                       Alternatively,
                                          p = v 2 /R = (23.7)2 /560 = 1.003 W
                       or
                                          p = i 2 R = (0.0424)2 (560) = 1.007 W
                       We note several things.
                          First, we calculated the power in three different ways, and we seem
                       to have obtained three different answers!
                          In reality, however, we rounded our voltage to three significant
                       digits, which will impact the accuracy of any subsequent quantity we
                       calculate with it. With this in mind, we see that the answers show rea-
                       sonable agreement (within 1%).
                          The other point worth noting is that the resistor is rated to 50 W—
                       since we are only dissipating approximately 2% of this value, the resis-
                       tor is in no danger of overheating.

 2.13 A 500 ft long 24 AWG soft copper wire is carrying a current of
 100 mA. What is the voltage dropped across the wire?
 Ans: 3.26 V.



Conductance
For a linear resistor the ratio of current to voltage is also a constant
                                 i   1
                                   =   =G                                    [7]
                                 v   R
where G is called the conductance. The SI unit of conductance is the
siemens (S), 1 A/V. An older, unofficial unit for conductance is the mho,
which was often abbreviated as     and is still occasionally written as −1 .
You will occasionally see it used on some circuit diagrams, as well as in cat-
alogs and texts. The same circuit symbol (Fig. 2.24d) is used to represent
both resistance and conductance. The absorbed power is again necessarily
positive and may be expressed in terms of the conductance by
                                                i2
                             p = vi = v 2 G =                                [8]
                                                G
    Thus a 2  resistor has a conductance of 12 S, and if a current of 5 A is
flowing through it, then a voltage of 10 V is present across the terminals and
a power of 50 W is being absorbed.
    All the expressions given so far in this section were written in terms
of instantaneous current, voltage, and power, such as v = iR and p = vi .
We should recall that this is a shorthand notation for v(t) = Ri(t) and
p(t) = v(t) i(t). The current through and voltage across a resistor must
both vary with time in the same manner. Thus, if R = 10  and
v = 2 sin 100t V, then i = 0.2 sin 100t A. Note that the power is given by
0.4 sin2 100t W, and a simple sketch will illustrate the different nature of
its variation with time. Although the current and voltage are each negative
during certain time intervals, the absorbed power is never negative!
    Resistance may be used as the basis for defining two commonly used
terms, short circuit and open circuit. We define a short circuit as a resistance
of zero ohms; then, since v = iR, the voltage across a short circuit must
be zero, although the current may have any value. In an analogous manner,
28                                                             CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS


                                                               we define an open circuit as an infinite resistance. It follows from Ohm’s law
                                                               that the current must be zero, regardless of the voltage across the open circuit.
                                                               Although real wires have a small resistance associated with them, we always
                                                               assume them to have zero resistance unless otherwise specified. Thus, in all

❑   Ohm’s law states that the voltage across a linear resistor is directly
    proportional to the current flowing through it; i.e., v = Ri. (Example 2.3)
❑   The power dissipated by a resistor (which leads to the production of
    heat) is given by p = vi = i 2R = v 2 /R. (Example 2.3)
❑   Wires are typically assumed to have zero resistance in circuit analysis.
    When selecting a wire gauge for a specific application, however, local
    electrical and fire codes must be consulted. (Example 2.4)

    power, and others are absorbing positive power. Determine which are which,
    and show that the algebraic sum of the power absorbed by each element
    (taking care to preserve signs) is equal to zero.
32. By careful measurements it is determined that a benchtop argon ion laser is
    consuming (absorbing) 1.5 kW of electric power from the wall outlet, but only
    producing 5 W of optical power. Where is the remaining power going? Doesn’t
    conservation of energy require the two quantities to be equal?
33. Refer to the circuit represented in Fig. 2.33, while noting that the same current
    flows through each element. The voltage-controlled dependent source provides
    a current which is 5 times as large as the voltage Vx . (a) For VR = 10 V and

52. Referring to the data of Table 2.4, design a resistor whose value can be varied
    mechanically in the range of 100 to 500  (assume operation at 20◦ C).
53. A 250 ft long span separates a dc power supply from a lamp which draws 25 A
    of current. If 14 AWG wire is used (note that two wires are needed for a total
    of 500 ft), calculate the amount of power wasted in the wire.
54. The resistance values in Table 2.4 are calibrated for operation at 20◦ C. They
    may be corrected for operation at other temperatures using the relationship4

    A piece of equipment relies on an external wire made of 28 AWG soft copper,
    which has a resistance of 50.0  at 20◦ C. Unfortunately, the operating
    environment has changed, and it is now 110.5◦ F. (a) Calculate the length of
    the original wire. (b) Determine by how much the wire should be shortened so
    that it is once again 50.0 .
55. Your favorite meter contains a precision (1% tolerance) 10  resistor.
    Unfortunately, the last person who borrowed this meter somehow blew the
    resistor, and it needs to be replaced. Design a suitable replacement, assuming
    at least 1000 ft of each of the wire gauges listed in Table 2.4 is readily
    available to you.
56. At a new installation, you specified that all wiring should conform to the
    ASTM B33 specification (see Table 2.3). Unfortunately the subcontractor
    misread your instructions and installed B415 wiring instead (but the same
    gauge). Assuming the operating voltage is unchanged, (a) by how much will
    the current be reduced, and (b) how much additional power will be wasted in
    the lines? (Express both answers in terms of percentage.)
57. If 1 mA of current is forced through a 1 mm diameter, 2.3 meter long piece of
    hard, round, aluminum-clad steel (B415) wire, how much power is wasted as
    a result of resistive losses? If instead wire of the same dimensions but
    conforming to B75 specifications is used, by how much will the power wasted
    due to resistive losses be reduced?

          voltage or current which exists elsewhere. Once we know the             Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)

          We now focus our attention on the current-voltage relationships in
          simple networks of two or more circuit elements. The elements will
          be connected by wires (sometimes referred to as “leads”), which have
          zero resistance. Since the network then appears as a number of sim-
          ple elements and a set of connecting leads, it is called a lumped-
          parameter network. A more difficult analysis problem arises when
          we are faced with a distributed-parameter network, which contains
          an essentially infinite number of vanishingly small elements. We will
          concentrate on lumped-parameter networks in this text.

                                                               nodes. Sometimes networks are drawn so as to trap an unwary student into

     therefore refer to “zero resistance” wires from now on.       Suppose that we start at one node in a network and move through a sim-

                                                               through a different element to the next node, and continue this movement

                                                               the same as the node on which we ended, then the path is, by definition, a

                                                               source to node 1, and then through the upper right resistor to node 3, we

                                                               of branches. The circuit shown in Fig. 3.1a and b contains five branches.

                                                                   This law represents a mathematical statement of the fact that charge
                                                               cannot accumulate at a node. A node is not a circuit element, and it certainly
                                                               cannot store, destroy, or generate charge. Hence, the currents must sum to
                                                               zero. A hydraulic analogy is sometimes useful here: for example, consider
                                                               three water pipes joined in the shape of a Y. We define three “currents” as
                                                               flowing into each of the three pipes. If we insist that water is always flow-

    Consider the node shown in Fig. 3.2. The algebraic sum of the four cur-

the currents leaving the node:
                      (−i A ) + (−i B ) + i C + i D = 0
    We might also wish to equate the sum of the currents having reference
arrows directed into the node to the sum of those directed out of the node:
                            i A + i B = iC + i D
which simply states that the sum of the currents going in must equal the sum
of the currents going out.

   It is always worth the effort to recheck our work. Also, we can

                                                                     •
                                                              Current is related to the charge flowing through a circuit element, whereas

if, instead, we choose to proceed from A to B via node C, then we expend
(v2 − v3 ) joules of energy. The work done, however, is independent of the
path in a circuit, and so any route must lead to the same value for the volt-
age. In other words,
                                  v1 = v2 − v3                                   [3]
   It follows that if we trace out a closed path, the algebraic sum of the volt-
ages across the individual elements around it must be zero. Thus, we may
write
                        v1 + v2 + v3 + · · · + v N = 0
or, more compactly,
                                  

                                   n=1

    We can apply KVL to a circuit in several different ways. One method
that leads to fewer equation-writing errors than others consists of moving
mentally around the closed path in a clockwise direction and writing down
directly the voltage of each element whose (+) terminal is entered, and
writing down the negative of every voltage first met at the (−) sign. Apply-
ing this to the single loop of Fig. 3.5, we have
                              −v1 + v2 − v3 = 0
which agrees with our previous result, Eq. [3].

    As we have just seen, the key to correctly analyzing a circuit is to first me-
thodically label all voltages and currents on the diagram. This way, carefully
written KCL or KVL equations will yield correct relationships, and Ohm’s
law can be applied as necessary if more unknowns than equations are ob-
tained initially. We illustrate these principles with a more detailed example.

              KVL. (b) Circuit with voltages and currents labeled.

 We begin by labeling voltages and currents on the rest of the elements
 in the circuit (Fig. 3.10b). Note that vx appears across the 2  resistor
 and the source i x as well.
     If we can obtain the current through the 2  resistor, Ohm’s law will
 yield vx . Writing the appropriate KCL equation, we see that
                                           i2 = i4 + i x
     Unfortunately, we do not have values for any of these three quanti-
 ties. Our solution has (temporarily) stalled.
     Since we were given the current flowing from the 60 V source, per-
 haps we should consider starting from that side of the circuit. Instead of
 finding vx using i 2 , it might be possible to find vx directly using KVL.
 We can write the following KVL equations:
                                       −60 + v8 + v10 = 0
 and
                                   −v10 + v4 + vx = 0                                    [5]
    This is progress: we now have two equations in four unknowns, an
 improvement over one equation in which all terms were unknown. In
 fact, we know that v8 = 40 V through Ohm’s law, as we were told that
 5 A flows through the 8  resistor. Thus, v10 = 0 + 60 − 40 = 20 V,

application of Kirchhoff’s current law assures us that this same current must
also flow through every other element in the circuit; we emphasize this fact
this one time by placing several other current symbols about the circuit.
    Our second step in the analysis is a choice of the voltage reference for each
of the two resistors. The passive sign convention requires that the resistor cur-
rent and voltage variables be defined so that the current enters the terminal at
which the positive voltage reference is located. Since we already (arbitrarily)
selected the current direction,v R1 andv R2 are defined as in Fig. 3.12c.
    The third step is the application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the only
closed path. Let us decide to move around the circuit in the clockwise
direction, beginning at the lower left corner, and to write down directly
every voltage first met at its positive reference, and to write down the nega-
tive of every voltage encountered at the negative terminal. Thus,
                             −vs1 + v R1 + vs2 + v R2 = 0                                         [6]
We then apply Ohm’s law to the resistive elements:
                             v R1 = R1 i        and v R2 = R2 i
Substituting into Eq. [6] yields
                             −vs1 + R1 i + vs2 + R2 i = 0
Since i is the only unknown, we find that
                                                vs1 − vs2

                                                R1 + R2
The voltage or power associated with any element may now be obtained by
applying v = Ri, p = vi , or p = i 2R.

                                                  We first assign a reference direction for the current i and a reference po-

                                                  the dependent source is already available. (It is worth noting, however,
                                                  that the reference signs for v A are reversed from those we would have
                                                  assigned based on the passive sign convention.)
                                                      This circuit contains a dependent voltage source, the value of which
                                                  remains unknown until we determine v A . However, its algebraic value
                                                  2v A can be used in the same fashion as if a numerical value were avail-
                                                  able. Thus, applying KVL around the loop:

                                                                         −120 + v30 + 2v A − v A = 0                        [7]

                                                  Using Ohm’s law to introduce the known resistor values:

                                                                         v30 = 30i    and v A = −15i

                                                  Note that the negative sign is required since i flows into the negative
                                                  terminal of v A .
                                                     Substituting into Eq. [7] yields

                                                                         −120 + 30i − 30i + 15i = 0

                                                  and so we find that

                                                 In the preceding example and practice problem, we were asked to compute
                                                 the power absorbed by each element of a circuit. It is difficult to think of a
                                                 situation, however, in which all of the absorbed power quantities of a circuit
                                                 would be positive, for the simple reason that the energy must come from
                                                 somewhere. Thus, from simple conservation of energy, we expect that the
                                                 sum of the absorbed power for each element of a circuit should be zero. In
                                          SECTION 3.5 THE SINGLE-NODE-PAIR CIRCUIT                 49

other words, at least one of the quantities should be negative (neglecting the
trivial case where the circuit is not operating). Stated another way, the sum
of the supplied power for each element should be zero. More pragmatically,
the sum of the absorbed power equals the sum of the supplied power,
which seems reasonable enough at face value.
    Let’s test this with the circuit of Fig. 3.13 from Example 3.5, which
consists of two sources (one dependent and one independent) and two
resistors. Adding the power absorbed by each element, we find
              
                     pabsorbed = −960 + 1920 − 1920 + 960 = 0
           all elements

In reality (our indication is the sign associated with the absorbed power)
the 120 V source supplies +960 W, and the dependent source supplies
+1920 W. Thus, the sources supply a total of 960 + 1920 = 2880 W. The
resistors are expected to absorb positive power, which in this case sums to a
total of 1920 + 960 = 2880 W. Thus, if we take into account each element
of the circuit,
                                        
                             pabsorbed =    psupplied

as we expect.
    Turning our attention to Practice Problem 3.6, the solution to which
the reader might want to verify, we see that the absorbed powers sum
to 0.768 + 1.92 + 0.2048 + 0.1792 − 3.072 = 0. Interestingly enough, the
12 V independent voltage source is absorbing +1.92 W, which means it is
dissipating power, not supplying it. Instead, the dependent voltage source
appears to be supplying all the power in this particular circuit. Is such a
thing possible? We usually expect a source to supply positive power, but
since we are employing idealized sources in our circuits, it is in fact possi-
ble to have a net power flow into any source. If the circuit is changed in
some way, the same source might then be found to supply positive power.
The result is not known until a circuit analysis has been completed.

3.5       THE SINGLE-NODE-PAIR CIRCUIT
      •
The companion of the single-loop circuit discussed in Sec. 3.4 is the single-
node-pair circuit, in which any number of simple elements are connected
between the same pair of nodes. An example of such a circuit is shown in
Fig. 3.15a. KVL forces us to recognize that the voltage across each branch
is the same as that across any other branch. Elements in a circuit having a
common voltage across them are said to be connected in parallel.


                                                                                     EXAMPLE 3.6
 Find the voltage, current, and power associated with each element
 in the circuit of Fig. 3.15a.
 We first define a voltage v and arbitrarily select its polarity as shown in
 Fig. 3.15b. Two currents, flowing in the resistors, are selected in con-
 formance with the passive sign convention, as shown in Fig. 3.15b.

                                      Determining either current i 1 or i 2 will enable us to obtain a value
                                   for v. Thus, our next step is to apply KCL to either of the two nodes in
                                   the circuit. Equating the algebraic sum of the currents leaving the upper
                                   node to zero:
                                                                     −120 + i 1 + 30 + i 2 = 0
                                         Writing both currents in terms of the voltage v using Ohm’s law
                                                                    i 1 = 30v    and i 2 = 15v
                                   we obtain
                                                                −120 + 30v + 30 + 15v = 0
                                         Solving this equation for v results in
                                                                                v=2V
                                   and invoking Ohm’s law then gives
                                                                    i 1 = 60 A and i 2 = 30 A
                                     The absorbed power in each element can now be computed. In the
                                   two resistors,
                                               p R1 = 30(2)2 = 120 W and                    p R2 = 15(2)2 = 60 W
                                   and for the two sources,
                                           p120A = 120(−2) = −240 W and                           p30A = 30(2) = 60 W
                                   Since the 120 A source absorbs negative 240 W, it is actually supplying
                                   power to the other elements in the circuit. In a similar fashion, we find
                                   that the 30 A source is actually absorbing power rather than supplying it.

 so that

 same as any other current would be, even though its exact value is not
 known until the circuit has been analyzed.

                                 sources in series may be replaced by an equivalent voltage source having a
                                 voltage equal to the algebraic sum of the individual sources (Fig. 3.19a).
                                 Parallel current sources may also be combined by algebraically adding the
                                 individual currents, and the order of the parallel elements may be rearranged
                                 as desired (Fig. 3.19b).

                                       To be able to combine the voltage sources, they must be in series. Since
                                       the same current (i) flows through each, this condition is satisfied.

Determine the voltage v in the circuit of Fig. 3.22a by first combin-
ing the sources into a single equivalent current source.
The sources may be combined if the same voltage appears across each
one, which we can easily verify is the case. Thus, we create a new
source, arrow pointing upward into the top node, by adding the currents
that flow into that node:
                                     2.5 − 2.5 − 3 = −3 A
One equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 3.22b.
   KCL then allows us to write

                                  5 5
Solving, we find v = 7.5 V.

                    To conclude the discussion of parallel and series source combinations,
                we should consider the parallel combination of two voltage sources and the
                series combination of two current sources. For instance, what is the equiva-
                lent of a 5 V source in parallel with a 10 V source? By the definition of a
                voltage source, the voltage across the source cannot change; by Kirchhoff’s
                voltage law, then, 5 equals 10 and we have hypothesized a physical impos-
                sibility. Thus, ideal voltage sources in parallel are permissible only when
                each has the same terminal voltage at every instant. In a similar way, two
                current sources may not be placed in series unless each has the same cur-
                rent, including sign, for every instant of time.


 EXAMPLE 3.10
                 Determine which of the circuits of Fig. 3.24 are valid.
                 The circuit of Fig. 3.24a consists of two voltage sources in parallel. The
                 value of each source is different, so this circuit violates KVL. For exam-
                 ple, if a resistor is placed in parallel with the 5 V source, it is also in paral-
                 lel with the 10 V source. The actual voltage across it is therefore ambigu-
                 ous, and clearly the circuit cannot be constructed as indicated. If we
                 attempt to build such a circuit in real life, we will find it impossible to
                 locate “ideal” voltage sources—all real-world sources have an internal
                 resistance. The presence of such resistance allows a voltage difference
                 between the two real sources. Along these lines, the circuit of Fig. 3.24b
                 is perfectly valid.

3.7            RESISTORS IN SERIES AND PARALLEL
           •
It is often possible to replace relatively complicated resistor combinations
with a single equivalent resistor. This is useful when we are not specifically
interested in the current, voltage, or power associated with any of the indi-
vidual resistors in the combinations. All the current, voltage, and power rela-
tionships in the remainder of the circuit will be unchanged.
     Consider the series combination of N resistors shown in Fig. 3.26a. We
want to simplify the circuit with replacing the N resistors with a single resistor
Req so that the remainder of the circuit, in this case only the voltage source,
does not realize that any change has been made. The current, voltage, and
power of the source must be the same before and after the replacement.
     First, apply KVL:
                                  vs = v1 + v2 + · · · + v N

and then Ohm’s law:
                vs = R1 i + R2 i + · · · + R N i = (R1 + R2 + · · · + R N )i

   Now compare this result with the simple equation applying to the equiv-                          Helpful Tip: Inspection of the KVL equation for any
alent circuit shown in Fig. 3.26b:                                                                  series circuit will show that the order in which elements
                                                                                                    are placed in such a circuit makes no difference.

                           (a)                                                (b)

56              CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS


                   Thus, the value of the equivalent resistance for N series resistors is

                                                 Req = R1 + R2 + · · · + R N                [8]

                    We are therefore able to replace a two-terminal network consisting of N
                series resistors with a single two-terminal element Req that has the same
                v-i relationship.
                    It should be emphasized again that we might be interested in the current,
                voltage, or power of one of the original elements. For example, the voltage
                of a dependent voltage source may depend upon the voltage across R3 .
                Once R3 is combined with several series resistors to form an equivalent re-
                sistance, then it is gone and the voltage across it cannot be determined until
                R3 is identified by removing it from the combination. In that case, it would
                have been better to look ahead and not make R3 a part of the combination
                initially.

 EXAMPLE 3.11
                 Use resistance and source combinations to determine the current i
                 in Fig. 3.27a and the power delivered by the 80 V source.
                 We first interchange the element positions in the circuit, being careful

 next step is to then combine the three voltage sources into an equivalent
 90 V source, and the four resistors into an equivalent 30  resistance,
 as in Fig. 3.27c. Thus, instead of writing
                  −80 + 10i − 30 + 7i + 5i + 20 + 8i = 0
 we have simply
                                   −90 + 30i = 0
 and so we find that
                                       i =3A
     In order to calculate the power delivered to the circuit by the 80 V
 source appearing in the given circuit, it is necessary to return to
 Fig. 3.27a with the knowledge that the current is 3 A. The desired
 power is then 80 V × 3 A  240 W.
     It is interesting to note that no element of the original circuit remains
 in the equivalent circuit.

     The simplified (equivalent) circuit is shown in Fig. 3.29b.
        A parallel combination is routinely indicated by the following shorthand
     notation:
                                         Req = R1 R2 R3

         The special case of only two parallel resistors is encountered fairly of-
     ten, and is given by

                                          Req = R1 R2

     Or, more simply,


                                                     R1 R2
                                          Req =                              [10]
                                                    R1 + R2


         The last form is worth memorizing, although it is a common error to
     attempt to generalize Eq. [10] to more than two resistors, e.g.,

                                                   R1 R2 R3
                                        Req =
                                                R1 + R2 + R3

        A quick look at the units of this equation will immediately show that the
     expression cannot possibly be correct.

We will seek to simplify the circuit before analyzing it, but take care
not to include the dependent source since its voltage and power charac-
teristics are of interest.
    Despite not being drawn adjacent to one another, the two indepen-
dent current sources are in fact in parallel, so we replace them with
a 2 A source.
    The two 6  resistors are in parallel and can be replaced with a
single 3  resistor in series with the 15  resistor. Thus, the two 6 
resistors and the 15  resistor are replaced by an 18  resistor
(Fig. 3.31b).
    No matter how tempting, we should not combine the remaining three
resistors; the controlling variable i3 depends on the 3  resistor and so
that resistor must remain untouched. The only further simplification,
then, is 9 18  = 6 , as shown in Fig. 3.31c.

                                                                             (Continued on next page)
60   CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS



           Applying KCL at the top node of Fig. 3.31c, we have
                                                           v
                               −0.9i 3 − 2 + i 3 +           =0
                                                           6

           Employing Ohm’s law,

                                           v = 3i 3

      which allows us to compute

                                                 10
                                          i3 =      A
                                                 3

         Thus, the voltage across the dependent source (which is the same as
      the voltage across the 3  resistor) is

                                     v = 3i 3 = 10 V

          The dependent source therefore furnishes v × 0.9i 3 =
      10(0.9)(10/3) = 30 W to the remainder of the circuit.
          Now if we are later asked for the power dissipated in the 15  resis-
      tor, we must return to the original circuit. This resistor is in series with
      an equivalent 3  resistor; a voltage of 10 V is across the 18  total;
      therefore, a current of 5/9 A flows through the 15  resistor and the
      power absorbed by this element is (5/9)2 (15) or 4.63 W.

  (b) R2 and R3 are in parallel, and R1 and R8 are in series. (c) There are no circuit

    Three final comments on series and parallel combinations might be
helpful. The first is illustrated by referring to Fig. 3.33a and asking, “Are vs
and R in series or in parallel?” The answer is “Both.” The two elements
carry the same current and are therefore in series; they also enjoy the same
voltage and consequently are in parallel.
    The second comment is a word of caution. Circuits can be drawn in such
a way as to make series or parallel combinations difficult to spot. In
Fig. 3.33b, for example, the only two resistors in parallel are R2 and R3 ,
while the only two in series are R1 and R8 .
    The final comment is simply that a simple circuit element need not be in
series or parallel with any other simple circuit element in a circuit. For exam-
ple, R4 and R5 in Fig. 3.33b are not in series or parallel with any other simple
circuit element, and there are no simple circuit elements in Fig. 3.33c that
are in series or parallel with any other simple circuit element. In other words,
we cannot simplify that circuit further using any of the techniques discussed
in this chapter.

         •
By combining resistances and sources, we have found one method of short-
ening the work of analyzing a circuit. Another useful shortcut is the appli-
cation of the ideas of voltage and current division. Voltage division is used
to express the voltage across one of several series resistors in terms of the

                                                      We first combine the 6  and 3  resistors, replacing them with
                                                      (6)(3)/(6 + 3) = 2 .
                                                         Since vx appears across the parallel combination, our simplification
                                                      has not lost this quantity. However, further simplification of the circuit

    Nature has not smiled on us here, for these last two equations have a
factor which differs subtly from the factor used with voltage division, and
some effort is going to be needed to avoid errors. Many students look on the
expression for voltage division as “obvious” and that for current division as
being “different.” It helps to realize that the larger of two parallel resistors
always carries the smaller current.
    For a parallel combination of N resistors, the current through resistor Rk is

                                                              We began this chapter by discussing connections of circuit elements, and
                                                              introducing the terms node, path, loop, and branch. The next two topics
                                                              could be considered the two most important in the entire textbook, namely,
                                                              Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law. The first is
                                                              derived from conservation of charge, and can be thought of in terms of
                                                              “what goes in (current) must come out.” The second is based on
                                                              conservation of energy, and can be viewed as “what goes up (potential)
                                                              must come down.” These two laws allow us to analyze any circuit, linear or
                                                              otherwise, provided we have a way of relating the voltage and current

                                                              each carries the same current. The single-node-pair circuit, in which
                                                              elements are connected in parallel with one another, is characterized by a
                                                              single voltage common to each element. Extending these concepts allowed

                                                              current sources in parallel; subsequently we obtained classic expressions
                                                              for series and parallel connected resistors. The final topic, that of voltage
                                                              and current division, finds considerable use in the design of circuits where a
                                                              specific voltage or current is required but our choice of source is limited.
                                                                  Let’s conclude with key points of this chapter to review, highlighting
                                                              appropriate examples.

❑   Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of the
    currents entering any node is zero. (Examples 3.1, 3.4)
❑   Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of the
    voltages around any closed path in a circuit is zero. (Examples 3.2, 3.3)
❑   All elements in a circuit that carry the same current are said to be
    connected in series. (Example 3.5)
❑   Elements in a circuit having a common voltage across them are said to
    be connected in parallel. (Examples 3.6, 3.7)
❑   Voltage sources in series can be replaced by a single source, provided
    care is taken to note the individual polarity of each source.
    (Examples 3.8, 3.10)
❑   Current sources in parallel can be replaced by a single source,
    provided care is taken to note the direction of each current arrow.
    (Examples 3.9, 3.10)
❑   A series combination of N resistors can be replaced by a single resistor
    having the value Req = R1 + R2 + · · · + R N . (Example 3.11)
❑   A parallel combination of N resistors can be replaced by a single
    resistor having the value
                            1    1    1           1

❑   Voltage division allows us to calculate what fraction of the total
    voltage across a series string of resistors is dropped across any one
    resistor (or group of resistors). (Example 3.13)
❑   Current division allows us to calculate what fraction of the total current
    into a parallel string of resistors flows through any one of the resistors.

     24. The circuit shown in Fig. 3.64 includes a device known as an op amp. This
         device has two unusual properties in the circuit shown: (1) Vd = 0 V, and
         (2) no current can flow into either input terminal (marked “−” and “+” inside
         the symbol), but it can flow through the output terminal (marked “OUT”).
         This seemingly impossible situation—in direct conflict with KCL—is a result
         of power leads to the device that are not included in the symbol. Based on this
         information, calculate Vout . (Hint: two KVL equations are required, both
         involving the 5 V source.)

          a simple linear circuit to obtain useful information such as the

          perhaps starting to seem a straightforward enough venture. Still,
          for the moment at least, every circuit seems unique, requiring (to          The Supermesh Technique
          some degree) a measure of creativity in approaching the analysis.
          In this chapter, we learn two basic circuit analysis techniques—            Choosing Between Nodal
          nodal analysis and mesh analysis—both of which allow us to                  and Mesh Analysis
          investigate many different circuits with a consistent, methodical
          approach. The result is a streamlined analysis, a more uniform              Computer-Aided Analysis,
          level of complexity in our equations, fewer errors and, perhaps             Including PSpice and
          most importantly, a reduced occurrence of “I don’t know how                 MATLAB
          to even start!”
              Most of the circuits we have seen up to now have been rather
          simple and (to be honest) of questionable practical use. Such
          circuits are valuable, however, in helping us to learn to apply
          fundamental techniques. Although the more complex circuits
          appearing in this chapter may represent a variety of electrical
          systems including control circuits, communication networks,
          motors, or integrated circuits, as well as electric circuit models
          of nonelectrical systems, we believe it best not to dwell on such
          specifics at this early stage. Rather, it is important to initially focus
          on the methodology of problem solving that we will continue to
          develop throughout the book.




                                                                                                                 79
80            CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS


              4.1        NODAL ANALYSIS
                     •
              We begin our study of general methods for methodical circuit analysis by
              considering a powerful method based on KCL, namely nodal analysis. In
              Chap. 3 we considered the analysis of a simple circuit containing only two
              nodes. We found that the major step of the analysis was obtaining a single
              equation in terms of a single unknown quantity—the voltage between the
              pair of nodes.
                  We will now let the number of nodes increase and correspondingly pro-
              vide one additional unknown quantity and one additional equation for each
              added node. Thus, a three-node circuit should have two unknown voltages
              and two equations; a 10-node circuit will have nine unknown voltages and
              nine equations; an N-node circuit will need (N − 1) voltages and (N − 1)
              equations. Each equation is a simple KCL equation.
                  To illustrate the basic technique, consider the three-node circuit shown
              in Fig. 4.1a, redrawn in Fig. 4.1b to emphasize the fact that there are only
              three nodes, numbered accordingly. Our goal will be to determine the volt-
              age across each element, and the next step in the analysis is critical. We des-
              ignate one node as a reference node; it will be the negative terminal of our
              N − 1 = 2 nodal voltages, as shown in Fig. 4.1c.
                  A little simplification in the resultant equations is obtained if the node
              connected to the greatest number of branches is identified as the reference
              node. If there is a ground node, it is usually most convenient to select it as
              the reference node, although many people seem to prefer selecting the bot-
              tom node of a circuit as the reference, especially if no explicit ground is
              noted.
                  The voltage of node 1 relative to the reference node is named v1 , and v2
              is defined as the voltage of node 2 with respect to the reference node. These

two voltages are all we need, as the voltage between any other pair of nodes        The reference node in a schematic is implicitly defined
may be found in terms of them. For example, the voltage of node 1 with              as zero volts. However, it is important to remember
respect to node 2 is v1 − v2 . The voltages v1 and v2 and their reference signs     that any terminal can be designated as the reference
are shown in Fig. 4.1c. It is common practice once a reference node has             terminal. Thus, the reference node is at zero volts with

is understood to be a type of shorthand voltage notation.
    We now apply KCL to nodes 1 and 2. We do this by equating the total
current leaving the node through the several resistors to the total source
current entering the node. Thus,
                              v1   v1 − v2
                                 +         = 3.1                             [1]
                              2       5
or
                             0.7v1 − 0.2v2 = 3.1                             [2]
     At node 2 we obtain
                           v2   v2 − v1
                              +         = −(−1.4)                            [3]
                           1       5
or
                            −0.2v1 + 1.2v2 = 1.4                             [4]
Equations [2] and [4] are the desired two equations in two unknowns, and
they may be solved easily. The results are v1 = 5 V and v2 = 2 V.
    From this, it is straightforward to determine the voltage across the 5 
resistor: v5 = v1 − v2 = 3 V. The currents and absorbed powers may also
be computed in one step.
    We should note at this point that there is more than one way to write the
KCL equations for nodal analysis. For example, the reader may prefer to
sum all the currents entering a given node and set this quantity to zero.
Thus, for node 1 we might have written
                                   v1   v1 − v2
                           3.1 −      −         =0
                                   2       5
or
                                   −v1   v2 − v1
                           3.1 +       +         =0
                                    2       5
either of which is equivalent to Eq. [1].
    Is one way better than any other? Every instructor and every student
develop a personal preference, and at the end of the day the most important
thing is to be consistent. The authors prefer constructing KCL equations for
nodal analysis in such a way as to end up with all current source terms on
one side and all resistor terms on the other. Specifically,
             
                 currents
                         entering the node from current sources
                 =    currents leaving the node through resistors

There are several advantages to such an approach. First, there is never any
confusion regarding whether a term should be “v1 − v2 ” or “v2 − v1 ;” the
82             CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS


               first voltage in every resistor current expression corresponds to the node for
               which a KCL equation is being written, as seen in Eqs. [1] and [3]. Second,
               it allows a quick check that a term has not been accidentally omitted. Sim-
               ply count the current sources connected to a node and then the resistors;
               grouping them in the stated fashion makes the comparison a little easier.

                Nodal analysis will directly yield numerical values for the nodal volt-
                ages v1 and v2 , and the desired current is given by i = (v1 − v2 )/15.
                   Before launching into nodal analysis, however, we first note that no
                details regarding either the 7  resistor or the 3  resistor are of inter-
                est. Thus, we may replace their series combination with a 10  resistor
                as in Fig. 4.2b. The result is a reduction in the number of equations to
                solve.

                    Rearranging, we obtain

                   Solving, we find that v1 = 20 V and v2 = 20 V so that v1 − v2 = 0.
                In other words, zero current is flowing through the 15  resistor in this
                circuit!

        (Appendix 5), software packages such as MATLAB, or more tradi-
        tional “plug-and-chug” techniques such as elimination of variables,
        matrix methods, or Cramer’s rule. Using the latter method, described
        in Appendix 2, we have

      Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
        Substituting the nodal voltages into any of our three nodal equations
        is sufficient to ensure we made no computational errors. Beyond that,
        is it possible to determine whether these voltages are “reasonable”
        values? We have a maximum possible current of 3 + 8 + 25 = 36
        amperes anywhere in the circuit. The largest resistor is 7 , so we do
        not expect any voltage magnitude greater than 7 × 36 = 252 V.



         There are, of course, numerous methods available for the solution of
     linear systems of equations, and we describe several in Appendix 2 in detail.
     Prior to the advent of the scientific calculator, Cramer’s rule as seen in
     Example 4.2 was very common in circuit analysis, although occasionally
     tedious to implement. It is, however, straightforward to use on a simple
                                                      SECTION 4.1 NODAL ANALYSIS   85

four-function calculator, and so an awareness of the technique can be
valuable. MATLAB, on the other hand, although not likely to be available
during an examination, is a powerful software package that can greatly sim-
plify the solution process; a brief tutorial on getting started is provided in
Appendix 6.
    For the situation encountered in Example 4.2, there are several options
available through MATLAB. First, we can represent Eqs. [7] to [9] in matrix
form:
          ⎡                                   ⎤⎡ ⎤ ⎡              ⎤
               0.5833 −0.3333 −0.25               v1         −11
          ⎣ −0.3333       1.4762 −0.1429 ⎦ ⎣ v2 ⎦ = ⎣ 3 ⎦
            −0.25       −0.1429       0.5929      v3           25
so that
          ⎡    ⎤ ⎡                           ⎤−1 ⎡     ⎤
            v1        0.5833 −0.3333 −0.25         −11
          ⎣ v2 ⎦ = ⎣ −0.3333  1.4762 −0.1429 ⎦ ⎣ 3 ⎦
            v3       −0.25   −0.1429  0.5929        25
   In MATLAB, we write

   >> a = [0.5833 -0.3333 -0.25; -0.3333 1.4762 -0.1429; -0.25 -0.1429 0.5929];
   >> c = [-11; 3; 25];
   >> b = a^-1 * c
   b =
       5.4124
       7.7375
      46.3127
   >>

where spaces separate elements along rows, and a semicolon separates
rows. The matrix named b, which can also be referred to as a vector as it has
only one column, is our solution. Thus, v1 = 5.412 V, v2 = 7.738 V, and
v3 = 46.31 V (some rounding error has been incurred).
   We could also use the KCL equations as we wrote them initially if we
employ the symbolic processor of MATLAB.
   >> eqn1 = '-8 -3 = (v1 - v2)/ 3 + (v1 - v3)/ 4';
   >> eqn2 = '-(-3) = (v2 - v1)/ 3 + v2/ 1 + (v2 - v3)/ 7';
   >> eqn3 = '-(-25) = v3/ 5 + (v3 - v2)/ 7 + (v3 - v1)/ 4';
   >> answer = solve(eqn1, eqn2, eqn3, 'v1', 'v2', 'v3');
   >> answer.v1
   ans =
   720/133
   >> answer.v2
   ans =
   147/19
   >> answer.v3
   ans =
   880/19
   >>

               which results in exact answers, with no rounding errors. The solve() routine
               is invoked with the list of symbolic equations we named eqn1, eqn2, and
               eqn3, but the variables v1, v2 and v3 must also be specified. If solve() is
               called with fewer variables than equations, an algebraic solution is returned.
               The form of the solution is worth a quick comment; it is returned in what is
               referred to in programming parlance as a structure; in this case, we called
               our structure “answer.’’ Each component of the structure is accessed sepa-
               rately by name as shown.

                  The previous examples have demonstrated the basic approach to nodal
               analysis, but it is worth considering what happens if dependent sources are
               present as well.

    We choose the bottom node as our reference, since it has a large
 number of branch connections, and proceed to label the nodal voltages
 v1 and v2 as shown in Fig. 4.6b. The quantity labeled vx is actually
 equal to v2 .
    At node 1, we write
                                 v1 − v2    v1
                          15 =            +                           [10]
                                     1      2
 and at node 2
                                  v2 − v1   v2
                          3i 1 =          +                           [11]
                                     1       3
     Unfortunately, we have only two equations but three unknowns; this
 is a direct result of the presence of the dependent current source, since
 it is not controlled by a nodal voltage. Thus, we need an additional
 equation that relates i1 to one or more nodal voltages.
     In this case, we find that
                                         v1
                                   i1 =                                 [12]
                                          2
 which upon substitution into Eq. [11] yields (with a little rearranging)
                              3v1 − 2v2 = 30                              [13]
 and Eq. [10] simplifies to
                              −15v1 + 8v2 = 0                             [14]
     Solving, we find that v1 = −40 V, v2 = −75 V, and i 1 = 0.5v1 =
 −20 A. Thus, the power supplied by the dependent source is equal to
 (3i 1 )(v2 ) = (−60)(−75) = 4.5 kW.



    We see that the presence of a dependent source will create the need for
an additional equation in our analysis if the controlling quantity is not a
nodal voltage. Now let’s look at the same circuit, but with the controlling
variable of the dependent current source changed to a different quantity—
the voltage across the 3  resistor, which is in fact a nodal voltage. We will
find that only two equations are required to complete the analysis.


                                                                                   EXAMPLE 4.4
 Determine the power supplied by the dependent source of Fig. 4.7a.
 We select the bottom node as our reference and label the nodal voltages
 as shown in Fig. 4.7b. We have labeled the nodal voltage vx explicitly
 for clarity. Note that our choice of reference node is important in this
 case; it led to the quantity vx being a nodal voltage.
    Our KCL equation for node 1 is
                                   v1 − vx     v1

                                                    2.    Designate a reference node. The number of terms in your nodal
                                                          equations can be minimized by selecting the node with the great-

                                                    3.    Label the nodal voltages (there are N − 1 of them).
                                                    4.    Write a KCL equation for each of the nonreference nodes.

                                                          the node through resistors. Pay close attention to “−” signs.

                                                          other than nodal voltages in terms of appropriate nodal
                                                          voltages. This situation can occur if voltage sources or dependent
                                                          sources appear in our circuit.

    These seven basic steps will work on any circuit we ever encounter,
although the presence of voltage sources will require extra care. Such situ-
ations are discussed next.

4.2       THE SUPERNODE
      •
As an example of how voltage sources are best handled when performing                                        4⍀
nodal analysis, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.9a. The original four-
node circuit of Fig. 4.4 has been changed by replacing the 7  resistor be-                             –3 A
tween nodes 2 and 3 with a 22 V voltage source. We still assign the same                                       v2
                                                                                                                        – +         v3
node-to-reference voltages v1 , v2 , and v3 . Previously, the next step was the         v1
                                                                                                    3⍀           22 V

                                                                                                                     5⍀
that once again, we see that we will run into some difficulty at both nodes 2                            1⍀
                                                                                             –8 A
and 3, for we do not know what the current is in the branch with the voltage
source. There is no way by which we can express the current as a function                                                      –25 A
of the voltage, for the definition of a voltage source is exactly that the volt-                      Reference node
age is independent of the current.                                                                          (a)
    There are two ways out of this dilemma. The more difficult approach is to
assign an unknown current to the branch which contains the voltage source,
proceed to apply KCL three times, and then apply KVL (v3 − v2 = 22) once
                                                                                                               – +
between nodes 2 and 3; the result is then four equations in four unknowns.                              22 V
    The easier method is to treat node 2, node 3, and the voltage source to-
gether as a sort of supernode and apply KCL to both nodes at the same time;
the supernode is indicated by the region enclosed by the broken line in                                       (b)

 Determine the value of the unknown node voltage v1 in the circuit
 of Fig. 4.9a.
 The KCL equation at node 1 is unchanged from Example 4.2:
                                   v1 − v2   v1 − v3
                       −8 − 3 =            +

    Next we consider the 2-3 supernode. Two current sources are con-
 nected, and four resistors. Thus,

                                         Since we have three unknowns, we need one additional equation,
                                      and it must utilize the fact that there is a 22 V voltage source between
                                      nodes 2 and 3:

                                            Solving Eqs. [17] to [19], the solution for v1 is 1.071 V.

                                         The presence of a voltage source thus reduces by 1 the number of
                                     nonreference nodes at which we must apply KCL, regardless of whether the
                                     voltage source extends between two nonreference nodes or is connected
                                     between a node and the reference. We should be careful in analyzing circuits
                                     such as that of Practice Problem 4.4. Since both ends of the resistor are part
                                     of the supernode, there must technically be two corresponding current terms
                                     in the KCL equation, but they cancel each other out. We can summarize the
                                     supernode method as follows:

                                       Summary of Supernode Analysis Procedure
                                       1.    Count the number of nodes (N).
                                       2.    Designate a reference node. The number of terms in your nodal
                                             equations can be minimized by selecting the node with the greatest
                                             number of branches connected to it.
                                       3.    Label the nodal voltages (there are N − 1 of them).
                                       4.    If the circuit contains voltage sources, form a supernode about
                                             each one. This is done by enclosing the source, its two terminals,
                                             and any other elements connected between the two terminals
                                             within a broken-line enclosure.
                                       5.    Write a KCL equation for each nonreference node and for
                                             each supernode that does not contain the reference node. Sum
                                             the currents flowing into a node/supernode from current sources
                                             on one side of the equation. On the other side, sum the currents
                                             flowing out of the node/supernode through resistors. Pay close
                                             attention to “−” signs.
                                       6.    Relate the voltage across each voltage source to nodal voltages.
                                             This is accomplished by simple application of KVL; one such
                                             equation is needed for each supernode defined.
                                       7.    Express any additional unknowns (i.e., currents or voltages other
                                             than nodal voltages) in terms of appropriate nodal voltages. This
                                             situation can occur if dependent sources appear in our circuit.
                                       8.    Organize the equations. Group terms according to nodal voltages.
                                       9.    Solve the system of equations for the nodal voltages (there will
                                             be N − 1 of them).

   We see that we have added two additional steps from our general nodal
analysis procedure. In reality, however, application of the supernode tech-
nique to a circuit containing voltage sources not connected to the reference
node will result in a reduction in the number of KCL equations required.
With this in mind, let’s consider the circuit of Fig. 4.11, which contains all
four types of sources and has five nodes.


                                                                                                                    EXAMPLE 4.6
 Determine the node-to-reference voltages in the circuit of Fig. 4.11.
 After establishing a supernode about each voltage source, we see that                                             v2
 we need to write KCL equations only at node 2 and at the supernode

    Finally, we express the dependent current source in terms of the
 assigned variables:
                          0.5vx = 0.5(v2 − v1 )                      [24]
    Five nodes requires four KCL equations in general nodal analysis,
 but we have reduced this requirement to only two, as we formed two
 separate supernodes. Each supernode required a KVL equation (Eq. [22]
 and v1 = −12, the latter written by inspection). Neither dependent
 source was controlled by a nodal voltage, so two additional equations
 were needed as a result.
    With this done, we can now eliminate vx and v y to obtain a set of                                           v2

    Equations [25] and [26] are independent equations; one cannot be de-
rived from the other. With two equations and two unknowns, the solution is
easily obtained:
                i1 = 6 A            i2 = 4 A            and         (i 1 − i 2 ) = 2 A
    If our circuit contains M meshes, then we expect to have M mesh cur-
rents and therefore will be required to write M independent equations.
    Now let us consider this same problem in a slightly different manner by
using mesh currents. We define a mesh current as a current that flows only
around the perimeter of a mesh. One of the greatest advantages in the use of
mesh currents is the fact that Kirchhoff's current law is automatically satis-
fied. If a mesh current flows into a given node, it flows out of it also.

                                                     in our study of the nodal analysis technique, dependent sources generally
                                                     require an additional equation besides the M mesh equations, unless the

 ■ FIGURE 4.22 (a) A circuit with a dependent source controlled by a voltage. (b) Circuit labeled

 In order to draw comparisons to Example 4.9 we use the same mesh
 current definitions, as shown in Fig. 4.22b.
    For the left mesh, KVL now yields
                               −5 − 2vx + 4(i 2 − i 1 ) + 4i 2 = 0                                [29]

 and for the right mesh we find the same as before, namely,
                                         4(i 1 − i 2 ) + 2i 1 + 3 = 0                             [30]

     Since the dependent source is controlled by the unknown voltage
 vx , we are faced with two equations in three unknowns. The way out of
 our dilemma is to construct an equation for vx in terms of mesh cur-
 rents, such as
                                              vx = 4(i 2 − i 1 )                                  [31]

   We simplify our system of equations by substituting Eq. [31] into
 Eq. [29], resulting in
                                                  4i 1 = 5

     Solving, we find that i 1 = 1.25 A. In this particular instance, Eq. [30]
 is not needed unless a value for i2 is desired.

    The mesh analysis procedure can be summarized by the seven basic
steps that follow. It will work on any planar circuit we ever encounter, al-
though the presence of current sources will require extra care. Such situa-
tions are discussed in Sec. 4.4.
98              CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS



                  Summary of Basic Mesh Analysis Procedure
                  1. Determine if the circuit is a planar circuit. If not, perform nodal
                     analysis instead.
                  2. Count the number of meshes (M). Redraw the circuit if
                     necessary.
                  3. Label each of the M mesh currents. Generally, defining all mesh
                     currents to flow clockwise results in a simpler analysis.
                  4. Write a KVL equation around each mesh. Begin with a conve-
                     nient node and proceed in the direction of the mesh current. Pay
                     close attention to “−” signs. If a current source lies on the periph-
                     ery of a mesh, no KVL equation is needed and the mesh current is
                     determined by inspection.
                  5. Express any additional unknowns such as voltages or currents
                     other than mesh currents in terms of appropriate mesh cur-
                     rents. This situation can occur if current sources or dependent
                     sources appear in our circuit.
                  6. Organize the equations. Group terms according to mesh currents.
                  7. Solve the system of equations for the mesh currents (there will
                     be M of them).

                is present in the network? Taking our lead from nodal analysis, we should
                feel that there are two possible methods. First, we could assign an unknown
                voltage across the current source, apply KVL around each mesh as before,
                and then relate the source current to the assigned mesh currents. This is gen-
                erally the more difficult approach.
                    A better technique is one that is quite similar to the supernode approach
                in nodal analysis. There we formed a supernode, completely enclosing
                the voltage source inside the supernode and reducing the number of non-
                reference nodes by 1 for each voltage source. Now we create a kind of
                “supermesh” from two meshes that have a current source as a common
                element; the current source is in the interior of the supermesh. We thus
                reduce the number of meshes by 1 for each current source present. If the
                current source lies on the perimeter of the circuit, then the single mesh in
                which it is found is ignored. Kirchhoff’s voltage law is thus applied only to
                those meshes or supermeshes in the reinterpreted network.

          We can now summarize the general approach to writing mesh equations,
      whether or not dependent sources, voltage sources, and/or current sources
      are present, provided that the circuit can be drawn as a planar circuit:


        Summary of Supermesh Analysis Procedure
        1. Determine if the circuit is a planar circuit. If not, perform nodal
           analysis instead.
        2. Count the number of meshes (M). Redraw the circuit if necessary.
        3. Label each of the M mesh currents. Generally, defining all mesh
           currents to flow clockwise results in a simpler analysis.
        4. If the circuit contains current sources shared by two meshes,
           form a supermesh to enclose both meshes. A highlighted enclo-
           sure helps when writing KVL equations.
        5. Write a KVL equation around each mesh/supermesh. Begin
           with a convenient node and proceed in the direction of the mesh
           current. Pay close attention to “−” signs. If a current source lies

       on the periphery of a mesh, no KVL equation is needed and the
       mesh current is determined by inspection.
  6.   Relate the current flowing from each current source to mesh
       currents. This is accomplished by simple application of KCL;
       one such equation is needed for each supermesh defined.
  7.   Express any additional unknowns such as voltages or currents
       other than mesh currents in terms of appropriate mesh cur-
       rents. This situation can occur if dependent sources appear in
       our circuit.
  8.   Organize the equations. Group terms according to nodal voltages.
  9.   Solve the system of equations for the mesh currents (there will
       be M of them).



4.5        NODAL VS. MESH ANALYSIS: A COMPARISON
       •
Now that we have examined two distinctly different approaches to circuit
analysis, it seems logical to ask if there is ever any advantage to using one
over the other. If the circuit is nonplanar, then there is no choice: only nodal
analysis may be applied.
    Provided that we are indeed considering the analysis of a planar circuit,
however, there are situations where one technique has a small advantage
over the other. If we plan to use nodal analysis, then a circuit with N nodes
will lead to at most (N − 1) KCL equations. Each supernode defined will
further reduce this number by 1. If the same circuit has M distinct meshes,
then we will obtain at most M KVL equations; each supermesh will reduce
this number by 1. Based on these facts, we should select the approach that
will result in the smaller number of simultaneous equations.
    If one or more dependent sources are included in the circuit, then each
controlling quantity may influence our choice of nodal or mesh analysis.
For example, a dependent voltage source controlled by a nodal voltage does
not require an additional equation when we perform nodal analysis. Like-
wise, a dependent current source controlled by a mesh current does not re-
quire an additional equation when we perform mesh analysis. What about
the situation where a dependent voltage source is controlled by a current?
Or the converse, where a dependent current source is controlled by a volt-
age? Provided that the controlling quantity can be easily related to mesh
currents, we might expect mesh analysis to be the more straightforward
option. Likewise, if the controlling quantity can be easily related to nodal
voltages, nodal analysis may be preferable. One final point in this regard is
to keep in mind the location of the source; current sources which lie on the
periphery of a mesh, whether dependent or independent, are easily treated
in mesh analysis; voltage sources connected to the reference terminal are
easily treated in nodal analysis.
    When either method results in essentially the same number of equations,
it may be worthwhile to also consider what quantities are being sought.
Nodal analysis results in direct calculation of nodal voltages, whereas mesh
analysis provides currents. If we are asked to find currents through a set of
resistors, for example, after performing nodal analysis, we must still invoke
Ohm’s law at each resistor to determine the current.

                 As an example, consider the circuit in Fig. 4.28. We wish to determine
             the current i x .
                 We choose the bottom node as the reference node, and note that there are
             four nonreference nodes. Although this means that we can write four dis-
             tinct equations, there is no need to label the node between the 100 V source
             and the 8  resistor, since that node voltage is clearly 100 V. Thus, we label
             the remaining node voltages v1, v2, and v3 as in Fig. 4.29.

                                                                    8A

     Next, we consider the same circuit using mesh analysis. We see in
Fig. 4.30 that we have four distinct meshes, although it is obvious that
i 4 = −8 A; we therefore need to write three distinct equations.
     Writing a KVL equation for meshes 1, 2, and 3:
−100 + 8i 1 + 4(i 1 − i 2 ) = 0                 or         12i1 − 4i2       = 100       [41]
4(i 2 − i 1 ) + 2i 2 + 3(i 2 − i 3 ) = 0        or         −4i1 + 9i2 − 3i3  0         [42]
3(i 3 − i 2 ) + 10(i 3 + 8) + 5i 3 = 0          or              −3i2 + 18i3  −80       [43]

   Solving, we find that i 2 (= i x ) = 2.79 A. For this particular problem,
mesh analysis proved to be simpler. Since either method is valid, however,
working the same problem both ways can also serve as a means to check our
answers.

4.6         COMPUTER-AIDED CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
        •
We have seen that it does not take many components at all to create a cir-
cuit of respectable complexity. As we continue to examine even more
complex circuits, it will become obvious rather quickly that it is easy to
make errors during the analysis, and verifying solutions by hand can be
time-consuming. A powerful computer software package known as PSpice
is commonly employed for rapid analysis of circuits, and the schematic
capture tools are typically integrated with either a printed circuit board or
integrated circuit layout tool. Originally developed in the early 1970s at the
University of California at Berkeley, SPICE (Simulation Program with
Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is now an industry standard. MicroSim Cor-
poration introduced PSpice in 1984, which built intuitive graphical inter-
faces around the core SPICE program. Depending on the type of circuit
application being considered, there are now several companies offering
variations of the basic SPICE package.
    Although computer-aided analysis is a relatively quick means of deter-
mining voltages and currents in a circuit, we should be careful not to allow
simulation packages to completely replace traditional “paper and pencil”
analysis. There are several reasons for this. First, in order to design we must
be able to analyze. Overreliance on software tools can inhibit the develop-
ment of necessary analytical skills, similar to introducing calculators too early
in grade school. Second, it is virtually impossible to use a complicated
software package over a long period of time without making some type of
data-entry error. If we have no basic intuition as to what type of answer to

      it is valid. Thus, the generic name really is a fairly accurate description:
      computer-aided analysis. Human brains are not obsolete. Not yet, anyway.
           As an example, consider the circuit of Fig. 4.15b, which includes two dc
      voltage sources and three resistors. We wish to simulate this circuit using
      PSpice so that we may determine the currents i1 and i2. Figure 4.31a shows
      the circuit as drawn using a schematic capture program.1
      (1) Refer to Appendix 4 for a brief tutorial on PSpice and schematic capture.

    In order to determine the mesh currents, we need only run a bias point sim-
ulation. Under PSpice, select New Simulation Profile, type in a name (such
as Example), and click on Create. Under the Analysis type: pull-down menu,
select Bias Point, then click on OK. Returning to the original schematic win-
dow, under PSpice select Run (or use either of the two shortcuts: pressing the
F11 key or clicking on the blue “Play” symbol). To see the currents calculated
by PSpice, make sure the current button is selected (Fig. 4.31b). The results of
our simulation are shown in Fig. 4.31c. We see that the two currents i1 and i2
are 6 A and 4 A, respectively, as we found previously.
    As a further example, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.32a. It contains
a dc voltage source, a dc current source, and a voltage-controlled current
source. We are interested in the three nodal voltages, which from either nodal
or mesh analysis are found to be 82.91 V, 69.9 V, and 59.9 V, respectively, as
we move from left to right across the top of the circuit. Figure 4.32b shows
this circuit after the simulation was performed. The three nodal voltages are
indicated directly on the schematic. Note that in drawing a dependent source
using the schematic capture tool, we must explicitly link two terminals of
the source to the controlling voltage or current.

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
Although Chap. 3 introduced KCL and KVL, both of which are sufficient to
enable us to analyze any circuit, a more methodical approach proves help-
ful in everyday situations. Thus, in this chapter we developed the nodal
analysis technique based on KCL, which results in a voltage at each node
108   CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS


      (with respect to some designated “reference” node). We generally need to
      solve a system of simultaneous equations, unless voltage sources are con-
      nected so that they automatically provide nodal voltages. The controlling
      quantity of a dependent source is written down just as we would write down
      the numerical value of an “independent” source. Typically an additional
      equation is then required, unless the dependent source is controlled by a
      nodal voltage. When a voltage source bridges two nodes, the basic tech-
      nique can be extended by creating a supernode; KCL dictates that the sum
      of the currents flowing into a group of connections so defined is equal to the
      sum of the currents flowing out.
          As an alternative to nodal analysis, the mesh analysis technique was de-
      veloped through application of KVL; it yields the complete set of mesh cur-
      rents, which do not always represent the net current flowing through any
      particular element (for example, if an element is shared by two meshes).
      The presence of a current source will simplify the analysis if it lies on the
      periphery of a mesh; if the source is shared, then the supermesh technique
      is best. In that case, we write a KVL equation around a path that avoids
      the shared current source, then algebraically link the two corresponding
      mesh currents using the source.
          A common question is: “Which analysis technique should I use?” We dis-
      cussed some of the issues that might go into choosing a technique for a given
      circuit. These included whether or not the circuit is planar, what types of
      sources are present and how they are connected, and also what specific infor-
      mation is required (i.e., a voltage, current, or power). For complex circuits, it
      may take a greater effort than it is worth to determine the “optimum” approach,
      in which case most people will opt for the method with which they feel most
      comfortable. We concluded the chapter by introducing PSpice, a common cir-
      cuit simulation tool, which is very useful for checking our results.
          At this point we wrap up by identifying key points of this chapter to re-
      view, along with relevant example(s).
      ❑ Start each analysis with a neat, simple circuit diagram. Indicate all
          element and source values. (Example 4.1)
      ❑ For nodal analysis,
          ❑ Choose one node as the reference node. Then label the node
             voltages v1 , v2 , . . . , v N −1 . Each is understood to be measured with
             respect to the reference node. (Examples 4.1, 4.2)
          ❑ If the circuit contains only current sources, apply KCL at each
             nonreference node. (Examples 4.1, 4.2)
          ❑ If the circuit contains voltage sources, form a supernode about each
             one, and then apply KCL at all nonreference nodes and supernodes.
             (Examples 4.5, 4.6)
      ❑ For mesh analysis, first make certain that the network is a planar network.
          ❑ Assign a clockwise mesh current in each mesh: i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i M .
             (Example 4.7)
          ❑ If the circuit contains only voltage sources, apply KVL around
             each mesh. (Examples 4.7, 4.8, 4.9)
          ❑ If the circuit contains current sources, create a supermesh for each
             one that is common to two meshes, and then apply KVL around
             each mesh and supermesh. (Examples 4.11, 4.12)
                                                                           EXERCISES   109

❑   Dependent sources will add an additional equation to nodal analysis
    if the controlling variable is a current, but not if the controlling variable is
    a nodal voltage. (Conversely, a dependent source will add an additional
    equation to mesh analysis if the controlling variable is a voltage, but not
    if the controlling variable is a mesh current). (Examples 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.9,
    4.10, 4.12)
❑   In deciding whether to use nodal or mesh analysis for a planar circuit, a
    circuit with fewer nodes/supernodes than meshes/supermeshes will
    result in fewer equations using nodal analysis.
❑   Computer-aided analysis is useful for checking results and analyzing
    circuits with large numbers of elements. However, common sense must
    be used to check simulation results.

          The techniques of nodal and mesh analysis described in Chap. 4              of Different Sources to Any
          are reliable and extremely powerful methods. However, both                  Current or Voltage
          require that we develop a complete set of equations to describe
          a particular circuit as a general rule, even if only one current,           Source Transformation as a
          voltage, or power quantity is of interest. In this chapter, we              Means of Simplifying Circuits
          investigate several different techniques for isolating specific parts
          of a circuit in order to simplify the analysis. After examining each        Thévenin’s Theorem
          of these techniques, we focus on how one might go about selecting
          one method over another.                                                    Norton’s Theorem

          All of the circuits which we plan to analyze can be classified as lin-
          ear circuits, so this is a good time to be more specific in defining        Maximum Power Transfer
          exactly what we mean by that. Having done this, we can then con-
          sider the most important consequence of linearity, the principle of
          superposition. This principle is very basic and will appear repeat-          ↔ Y Transformations for

          nonapplicability of superposition to nonlinear circuits is the very
          reason they are so difficult to analyze!                                    Selecting a Particular

                                                       we simply mean that multiplication of the current through the element by a
                                                       constant K results in the multiplication of the voltage across the element by
                                                       the same constant K. At this time, only one passive element has been defined
                                                       (the resistor), and its voltage-current relationship

                                                       the result is a straight line.
                                                           We define a linear dependent source as a dependent current or voltage

                                                           We now define a linear circuit as a circuit composed entirely of inde-

                                                       definition, it is possible to show1 that “the response is proportional to the
                                                       source,’’ or that multiplication of all independent source voltages and cur-

    These three sets of equations describe the same circuit with three differ-
ent sets of source currents. Let us add or “superpose’’ the last two sets of
equations. Adding Eqs. [3] and [5],

              (0.7v1x + 0.7v1y ) − (0.2v2x + 0.2v2y ) = i ax + i ay                   [7]

and adding Eqs. [4] and [6],

             −(0.2v1x + 0.2v1y ) + (1.2v2x + 1.2v2y ) = i bx + i by                   [8]

    The linearity of all these equations allows us to compare Eq. [7] with                            0V      –     but current can
Eq. [1] and Eq. [8] with Eq. [2] and draw an interesting conclusion. If we                                          flow
select i ax and i ay such that their sum is ia and select i bx and i by such that their
sum is ib, then the desired responses v1 and v2 may be found by adding v1x                                                  (a)

theorem can be stated as:                                                                     like an open circuit.

     In any linear resistive network, the voltage across or the current through any re-
     sistor or source may be calculated by adding algebraically all the individual
     voltages or currents caused by the separate independent sources acting alone,
     with all other independent voltage sources replaced by short circuits and all
     other independent current sources replaced by open circuits.

    Thus, if there are N independent sources, we must perform N experi-
ments, each having only one of the independent sources active and the
others inactive/turned off/zeroed out. Note that dependent sources are in
general active in every experiment.
    There is also no reason that an independent source must assume only its
given value or a zero value in the several experiments; it is necessary only
for the sum of the several values to be equal to the original value. An inac-
tive source almost always leads to the simplest circuit, however.
    The circuit we have just used as an example should indicate that a much
stronger theorem might be written; a group of independent sources may be
made active and inactive collectively, if we wish. For example, suppose
there are three independent sources. The theorem states that we may find a
given response by considering each of the three sources acting alone and
adding the three results. Alternatively, we may find the response due to the
first and second sources operating with the third inactive, and then add to
this the response caused by the third source acting alone. This amounts to
treating several sources collectively as a sort of “supersource.”

  EXAMPLE 5.1
                 For the circuit of Fig. 5.3a, use superposition to determine the
                 unknown branch current ix.

                   source short-circuited.


                 First set the current source equal to zero and redraw the circuit
                 as shown in Fig. 5.3b. The portion of ix due to the voltage source
                 has been designated i x to avoid confusion and is easily found to be
                 0.2 A.
                    Next set the voltage source in Fig. 5.3a to zero and again redraw the
                 circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.3c. Current division lets us determine that i x
                 (the portion of ix due to the 2 A current source) is 0.8 A.
                    Now compute the total current ix by adding the two individual
                 components:

                                                 i x = i x|3 V + i x|2 A = i x + i x

                 or
                                                     
                                          3        6
                                    ix =     +2         = 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.0 A
                                         6+9      6+9




                   Another way of looking at Example 5.1 is that the 3 V source and the
                2 A source are each performing work on the circuit, resulting in a total cur-
                rent ix flowing through the 9  resistor. However, the contribution of the 3 V
                source to ix does not depend on the contribution of the 2 A source, and vice
                versa. For example, if we double the output of the 2 A source to 4 A, it will
                now contribute 1.6 A to the total current ix flowing through the 9  resistor.
                However, the 3 V source will still contribute only 0.2 A to ix, for a new total
                current of 0.2 + 1.6 = 1.8 A.

    As we will see, superposition does not generally reduce our workload
when considering a particular circuit, since it leads to the analysis of several
new circuits to obtain the desired response. However, it is particularly use-
ful in identifying the significance of various parts of a more complex circuit.
It also forms the basis of phasor analysis, which is introduced in Chap. 10.

                                                                                                     EXAMPLE 5.2

 Identify the goal of the problem.
   Each resistor is rated to a maximum of 250 mW. If the circuit allows
   this value to be exceeded (by forcing too much current through
   either resistor), excessive heating will occur—possibly leading to                               (Continued on next page)

         an accident. The 6 V source cannot be changed, so we are looking for an
         equation involving Ix and the maximum current through each resistor.
       Collect the known information.
         Based on its 250 mW power rating, the maximum current the 100 
         resistor can tolerate is

         and, similarly, the current through the 64  resistor must be less than
         62.5 mA.
       Devise a plan.
         Either nodal or mesh analysis may be applied to the solution of this
         problem, but superposition may give us a slight edge, since we are
         primarily interested in the effect of the current source.

         to the 100  resistor and, since the 64  resistor is in series, i 64         =
         36.59 mA as well.
                                                                                   
             Recognizing the current divider in Fig. 5.5c, we note that i 64           will
                                                                   
         add to i 64  , but i 100     is opposite in direction to i 100  . Therefore,
         IX can safely contribute 62.5 − 36.59 = 25.91 mA to the 64  resistor
         current, and 50 − (−36.59) = 86.59 mA to the 100  resistor current.
             The 100  resistor therefore places the following constraint on Ix:
                                                                       
                                                            100 + 64
                                  Ix < (86.59 × 10−3 )
                                                                64
         and the 64  resistor requires that
                                                                       
                                                            100 + 64
                                  Ix < (25.91 × 10−3 )
                                                               100
       Attempt a solution.
         Considering the 100  resistor first, we see that Ix is limited to Ix <
         221.9 mA. The 64  resistor limits Ix such that Ix < 42.49 mA. In
         order to satisfy both constraints, Ix must be less than 42.49 mA. If the
         value is increased, the 64  resistor will overheat long before the
         100  resistor does.
       Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
         One particularly useful way to evaluate our solution is to perform a dc
         sweep analysis in PSpice as described after the next example. An in-
         teresting question, however, is whether we would have expected the
         64  resistor to overheat first.
             Originally we found that the 100  resistor has a smaller
         maximum current, so it might be reasonable to expect it to limit Ix.
         However, because Ix opposes the current sent by the 6 V source
         through the 100  resistor but adds to the 6 V source’s contribution
         to the current through the 64  resistor, it turns out to work the other
         way—it’s the 64  resistor that sets the limit on Ix.

      source open-circuited. (c) Original circuit with the 10 V source short-circuited.

First open-circuit the 3 A source (Fig. 5.6b). The single mesh equation
is
                         −10 + 2i x + i x + 2i x = 0
so that
                                 i x = 2 A
   Next, short-circuit the 10 V source (Fig. 5.6c) and write the single-
node equation
                            v    v  − 2i x

                            2           1
and relate the dependent-source-controlling quantity to v  :
                                          v  = 2(−i x )
   Solving, we find
                                          i x = −0.6 A
and, thus,
                            i x = i x + i x = 2 + (−0.6) = 1.4 A
   Note that in redrawing each subcircuit, we are always careful to
use some type of notation to indicate that we are not working with the
original variables. This prevents the possibility of rather disastrous
errors when we add the individual results.                                                                           v1    15 ⍀       v2

                              Summary of Basic Superposition Procedure
                              1.   Select one of the independent sources. Set all other indepen-
                                   dent sources to zero. This means voltage sources are replaced
                                   with short circuits and current sources are replaced with open
                                   circuits. Leave dependent sources in the circuit.
                              2.   Relabel voltages and currents using suitable notation (e.g.,
                                   v  , i 2 ). Be sure to relabel controlling variables of dependent
                                   sources to avoid confusion.
                              3.   Analyze the simplified circuit to find the desired currents
                                   and/or voltages.
                              4.   Repeat steps 1 through 3 until each independent source has
                                   been considered.
                              5.   Add the partial currents and/or voltages obtained from the
                                   separate analyses. Pay careful attention to voltage signs and
                                   current directions when summing.
                              6.   Do not add power quantities. If power quantities are required,
                                   calculate only after partial voltages and/or currents have been
                                   summed.


                                 Note that step 1 may be altered in several ways. First, independent
                            sources can be considered in groups as opposed to individually if it simpli-
                            fies the analysis, as long as no independent source is included in more than
                            one subcircuit. Second, it is technically not necessary to set sources to zero,
                            although this is almost always the best route. For example, a 3 V source may
                            appear in two subcircuits as a 1.5 V source, since 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 V just as
                            0 + 3 = 3 V. Because it is unlikely to simplify our analysis, however, there
                            is little point to such an exercise.


  COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
                             Although PSpice is extremely useful in verifying that we have analyzed
                             a complete circuit correctly, it can also assist us in determining the
                             contribution of each source to a particular response. To do this, we
                             employ what is known as a dc parameter sweep.
                                 Consider the circuit presented in Example 5.2, when we were asked
                             to determine the maximum positive current that could be obtained from
                             the current source without exceeding the power rating of either resistor
                             in the circuit. The circuit is shown redrawn using the Orcad Capture
                             CIS schematic tool in Fig. 5.8. Note that no value has been assigned
                             to the current source.
                                 After the schematic has been entered and saved, the next step is
                             to specify the dc sweep parameters. This option allows us to specify
                             a range of values for a voltage or current source (in the present case,
                             the current source Ix ), rather than a specific value. Selecting New
                             Simulation Profile under PSpice, we provide a name for our profile
                             and are then provided with the dialog box shown in Fig. 5.9.

■ FIGURE 5.8       The circuit from Example 5.2.




■ FIGURE 5.9 DC Sweep dialog box shown with Ix selected as the sweep variable.

    Under Analysis Type, we pull down the DC Sweep option, specify
the “sweep variable’’ as Current Source, and then type in Ix in the
Name box. There are several options under Sweep Type: Linear,
Logarithmic, and Value List. The last option allows us to specify each
value to assign to Ix . In order to generate a smooth plot, however, we
choose to perform a Linear sweep, with a Start Value of 0 mA, an
End Value of 50 mA, and a value of 0.01 mA for the Increment.
    After we perform the simulation, the graphical output package Probe
is automatically launched. When the window appears, the horizontal
axis (corresponding to our variable, Ix ) is displayed, but the vertical
axis variable must be chosen. Selecting Add Trace from the Trace
menu, we click on I(R1), then type an asterisk in the Trace Expression
box, click on I(R1) once again, insert yet another asterisk, and finally
type in 100. This asks Probe to plot the power absorbed by the 100 
resistor. In a similar fashion, we repeat the process to add the power
                                                                  (Continued on next page)

       absorbed by the 64  resistor, resulting in a plot similar to that shown
       in Fig. 5.10a. A horizontal reference line at 250 mW was also added to
       the plot by typing 0.250 in the Trace Expression box after selecting
       Add Trace from the Trace menu a third time.
          We see from the plot that the 64  resistor does exceed its 250 mW
       power rating in the vicinity of Ix = 43 mA. In contrast, however, we
       also see that regardless of the value of the current source Ix (provided
       that it is between 0 and 50 mA), the 100  resistor will never dissipate
       250 mW; in fact, the absorbed power decreases with increasing current
       from the current source. If we desire a more precise answer, we can make
       use of the cursor tool, which is invoked by selecting Trace, Cursor,
       Display from the menu bar. Figure 5.10b shows the result of dragging
       cursor 1 to 42.52 A, where the 64  resistor is dissipating just over its
       maximum rated power of 250 mW. Increased precision can be obtained
       by decreasing the increment value used in the dc sweep.
          This technique is very useful in analyzing electronic circuits, where
       we might need, for example, to determine what input voltage is required
                                              SECTION 5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS                                                     133


 to a complicated amplifier circuit in order to obtain a zero output
 voltage. We also notice that there are several other types of parameter
 sweeps that we can perform, including a dc voltage sweep. The ability to
 vary temperature is useful only when dealing with component models
 that have a temperature parameter built in, such as diodes and transistors.



    Unfortunately, it usually turns out that little if any time is saved in ana-
lyzing a circuit containing one or more dependent sources by use of the
superposition principle, for there must always be at least two sources in
operation: one independent source and all the dependent sources.
    We must constantly be aware of the limitations of superposition. It is
applicable only to linear responses, and thus the most common nonlinear
response—power—is not subject to superposition. For example, consider
two 1 V batteries in series with a 1  resistor. The power delivered to the re-
sistor is 4 W, but if we mistakenly try to apply superposition, we might say
that each battery alone furnished 1 W and thus the calculated power is only
2 W. This is incorrect, but a surprisingly easy mistake to make.

5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS
     •
Practical Voltage Sources
So far, we’ve only worked with ideal sources—elements whose terminal
voltage is independent of the current flowing through them. To see the
relevance of this fact, consider a simple independent (“ideal”) 9 V source
connected to a 1  resistor. The 9 volt source will force a current of 9 amperes

current is flowing through it, and a reduced voltage of 11 V when 100 A is
flowing. How could we model this behavior? Well, a more accurate model
might be an ideal voltage source of 12 V in series with a resistor across
which 1 V appears when 100 A flows through it. A quick calculation shows
that the resistor must be 1 V/100 A  0.01 , and the ideal voltage source
and this series resistor constitute a practical voltage source (Fig. 5.11b).

Once again, these values are the intercepts for the straight line in Fig. 5.13b,
and they serve to define it completely.

Practical Current Sources
An ideal current source is also nonexistent in the real world; there is no
physical device that will deliver a constant current regardless of the load re-
sistance to which it is connected or the voltage across its terminals. Certain                                                  iL
transistor circuits will deliver a constant current to a wide range of load re-                                            +
sistances, but the load resistance can always be made sufficiently large that
the current through it becomes very small. Infinite power is simply never                     is               Rp          vL           RL

source current are approximately equal only for small values of load volt-
age, which are obtained with values of RL that are small compared to Rp.

Equivalent Practical Sources
It may be no surprise that we can improve upon models to increase their
accuracy; at this point we now have a practical voltage source model and
also a practical current source model. Before we proceed, however, let’s
take a moment to compare Fig. 5.13b and Fig. 5.14b. One is for a circuit
with a voltage source and the other, with a current source, but the graphs are
indistinguishable!
    It turns out that this is no coincidence. In fact, we are about to show that
a practical voltage source can be electrically equivalent to a practical cur-
rent source—meaning that a load resistor RL connected to either will have

Calculate the current through the 2  resistor in Fig. 5.19a by
making use of source transformations to first simplify the circuit.
We begin by transforming each current source into a voltage source
(Fig. 5.19b), the strategy being to convert the circuit into a simple loop.
   We must be careful to retain the 2  resistor for two reasons: first, the
dependent source controlling variable appears across it, and second, we
desire the current flowing through it. However, we can combine the 17 
and 9  resistors, since they appear in series. We also see that the 3  and
4  resistors may be combined into a single 7  resistor, which can then
be used to transform the 15 V source into a 15/7 A source as in Fig. 5.19c.
   Finally, we note that the two 7  resistors can be combined into a
single 3.5  resistor, which may be used to transform the 15/7 A
current source into a 7.5 V voltage source. The result is a simple
loop circuit, shown in Fig. 5.19d.
   The current I can now be found using KVL:
                       −7.5 + 3.5I − 51Vx + 28I + 9 = 0
where
                                           Vx = 2I
   Thus,
                                       I = 21.28 mA
                                                                      (Continued on next page)

Several Key Points
We conclude our discussion of practical sources and source transformations
with a few observations. First, when we transform a voltage source, we
must be sure that the source is in fact in series with the resistor under con-
sideration. For example, in the circuit of Fig. 5.21, it is perfectly valid to
perform a source transformation on the voltage source using the 10  resis-
tor, as they are in series. However, it would be incorrect to attempt a source
transformation using the 60 V source and the 30  resistor—a very common
type of error.
    In a similar fashion, when we transform a current source and resistor
combination, we must be sure that they are in fact in parallel. Consider the
current source shown in Fig. 5.22a. We may perform a source transforma-
tion including the 3  resistor, as they are in parallel, but after the transfor-
mation there may be some ambiguity as to where to place the resistor. In
such circumstances, it is helpful to first redraw the components to be trans-
formed as in Fig. 5.22b. Then the transformation to a voltage source in
series with a resistor may be drawn correctly as shown in Fig. 5.22c; the
resistor may in fact be drawn above or below the voltage source.
    It is also worthwhile to consider the unusual case of a current source in
series with a resistor, and its dual, the case of a voltage source in parallel

      with a resistor. Let’s start with the simple circuit of Fig. 5.23a, where we are
      interested only in the voltage across the resistor marked R2. We note that re-
      gardless of the value of resistor R1 , VR2 = Ix R2 . Although we might be
      tempted to perform an inappropriate source transformation on such a cir-
      cuit, in fact we may simply omit resistor R1 (provided that it is of no interest
      to us itself). A similar situation arises with a voltage source in parallel with
      a resistor, as depicted in Fig. 5.23b. Again, if we are only interested in some
      quantity regarding resistor R2, we may find ourselves tempted to perform
      some strange (and incorrect) source transformation on the voltage source
      and resistor R1. In reality, we may omit resistor R1 from our circuit as far as
      resistor R2 is concerned—its presence does not alter the voltage across, the
      current through, or the power dissipated by resistor R2.

           Summary of Source Transformation
           1.   A common goal in source transformation is to end up with
                either all current sources or all voltage sources in the circuit.
                This is especially true if it makes nodal or mesh analysis easier.
           2.   Repeated source transformations can be used to simplify a
                circuit by allowing resistors and sources to eventually be
                combined.
           3.   The resistor value does not change during a source transfor-
                mation, but it is not the same resistor. This means that currents
                or voltages associated with the original resistor are irretrievably
                lost when we perform a source transformation.
           4.   If the voltage or current associated with a particular resistor is
                used as a controlling variable for a dependent source, it should
                not be included in any source transformation. The original
                resistor must be retained in the final circuit, untouched.
           5.   If the voltage or current associated with a particular element is
                of interest, that element should not be included in any source
                transformation. The original element must be retained in the final
                circuit, untouched.
           6.   In a source transformation, the head of the current source
                arrow corresponds to the “+” terminal of the voltage source.
           7.   A source transformation on a current source and resistor
                requires that the two elements be in parallel.
           8.   A source transformation on a voltage source and resistor
                requires that the two elements be in series.

5.3 THÉVENIN AND NORTON EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
      •
Now that we have been introduced to source transformations and the super-
position principle, it is possible to develop two more techniques that will
greatly simplify the analysis of many linear circuits. The first of these theo-
rems is named after L. C. Thévenin, a French engineer working in telegra-
phy who published the theorem in 1883; the second may be considered a
corollary of the first and is credited to E. L. Norton, a scientist with the Bell
Telephone Laboratories.
    Let us suppose that we need to make only a partial analysis of a circuit.
For example, perhaps we need to determine the current, voltage, and power
delivered to a single “load” resistor by the remainder of the circuit, which
may consist of a sizable number of sources and resistors (Fig. 5.24a). Or,
perhaps we wish to find the response for different values of the load resis-
tance. Thévenin’s theorem tells us that it is possible to replace everything
except the load resistor with an independent voltage source in series with a
resistor (Fig. 5.24b); the response measured at the load resistor will be un-
changed. Using Norton’s theorem, we obtain an equivalent composed of an
independent current source in parallel with a resistor (Fig. 5.24c).

■ FIGURE 5.24 (a) A complex network including a load resistor RL. (b) A Thévenin equivalent
  network connected to the load resistor RL. (c) A Norton equivalent network connected to the load
  resistor RL.

    Thus, one of the main uses of Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems is the
replacement of a large part of a circuit, often a complicated and uninter-
esting part, with a very simple equivalent. The new, simpler circuit
enables us to make rapid calculations of the voltage, current, and power
which the original circuit is able to deliver to a load. It also helps us to
choose the best value of this load resistance. In a transistor power
amplifier, for example, the Thévenin or Norton equivalent enables us to
determine the maximum power that can be taken from the amplifier and
delivered to the speakers.


                                                                                                          EXAMPLE 5.6
  Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 5.25a. Determine the Thévenin
  equivalent of network A, and compute the power delivered to the
  load resistor RL.
  The dashed regions separate the circuit into networks A and B; our main
  interest is in network B, which consists only of the load resistor R L . Net-
  work A may be simplified by making repeated source transformations.

                                        then combined into 2  (Fig. 5.25c), and the practical current source that
                                        results is transformed back into a practical voltage source (Fig. 5.25d).
                                        The final result is shown in Fig. 5.25e.
                                           From the viewpoint of the load resistor R L , this network A (the
                                        Thévenin equivalent) is equivalent to the original network A; from our
                                        viewpoint, the circuit is much simpler, and we can now easily compute
                                        the power delivered to the load:
                                                                                   2
                                                                               8
                                                                    PL =               RL
                                                                            9 + RL
                                           Furthermore, we can see from the equivalent circuit that the maxi-
                                        mum voltage that can be obtained across R L is 8 V and corresponds to
                                        R L = ∞. A quick transformation of network A to a practical current
                                        source (the Norton equivalent) indicates that the maximum current that
                                        may be delivered to the load is 8/9 A, which occurs when R L = 0.
                                        Neither of these facts is readily apparent from the original circuit.

Thévenin’s Theorem
Using the technique of source transformation to find a Thévenin or Norton
equivalent network worked well enough in Example 5.6, but it can rapidly
become impractical in situations where dependent sources are present or
the circuit is composed of a large number of elements. An alternative is to
employ Thévenin’s theorem (or Norton’s theorem) instead. We will state
the theorem3 as a somewhat formal procedure and then consider various
ways to make the approach more practical depending on the situation
we face.

  A Statement of Thévenin’s Theorem
  1. Given any linear circuit, rearrange it in the form of two
     networks, A and B, connected by two wires. Network A is
     the network to be simplified; B will be left untouched.
  2. Disconnect network B. Define a voltage voc as the voltage now
     appearing across the terminals of network A.
  3. Turn off or “zero out” every independent source in network A
     to form an inactive network. Leave dependent sources
     unchanged.
  4. Connect an independent voltage source with value voc in series
     with the inactive network. Do not complete the circuit; leave the
     two terminals disconnected.
  5. Connect network B to the terminals of the new network A.
     All currents and voltages in B will remain unchanged.


    Note that if either network contains a dependent source, its control
variable must be in the same network.
    Let us see if we can apply Thévenin’s theorem successfully to the circuit
we considered in Fig. 5.25. We have already found the Thévenin equivalent
of the circuit to the left of R L in Example 5.6, but we want to see if there is
an easier way to obtain the same result.


                                                                                                               EXAMPLE 5.7
  Use Thévenin’s theorem to determine the Thévenin equivalent for
  that part of the circuit in Fig. 5.25a to the left of RL.
  We begin by disconnecting R L , and note that no current flows through
  the 7  resistor in the resulting partial circuit shown in Fig. 5.27a.
  Thus, Voc appears across the 6  resistor (with no current through the
  7  resistor there is no voltage drop across it), and voltage division
  enables us to determine that
                                              
                                           6
                            Voc = 12              =8V
                                        3+6


(3) A proof of Thévenin’s theorem in the form in which we have stated it is rather lengthy, and therefore it
has been placed in Appendix 3, where the curious may peruse it.

                                        as Voc. (b) The independent source in Fig. 5.25a has been killed, and we
                                        look into the terminals where network B was connected to determine the
                                        effective resistance of network A.


                                         Turning off network A (i.e., replacing the 12 V source with a short
                                      circuit) and looking back into the dead network, we see a 7  resistor
                                      connected in series with the parallel combination of 6  and 3 
                                      (Fig. 5.27b).
                                         Thus, the inactive network can be represented here by a 9  resistor,
                                      referred to as the Thévenin equivalent resistance of network A. The
                                      Thévenin equivalent then is Voc in series with a 9  resistor, which
                                      agrees with our previous result.

                                  A Few Key Points
                                  The equivalent circuit we have learned how to obtain is completely inde-
                                  pendent of network B: we have been instructed to first remove network B and
                                  then measure the open-circuit voltage produced by network A, an operation
                                  that certainly does not depend on network B in any way. The B network is
                                  mentioned only to indicate that an equivalent for A may be obtained no mat-
                                  ter what arrangement of elements is connected to the A network; the B net-
                                  work represents this general network.
                                      There are several points about the theorem which deserve emphasis.
                                  •     The only restriction that we must impose on A or B is that all
                                        dependent sources in A have their control variables in A, and similarly
                                        for B.
                                  •     No restrictions are imposed on the complexity of A or B; either one
                                        may contain any combination of independent voltage or current
                                        sources, linear dependent voltage or current sources, resistors, or any
                                        other circuit elements which are linear.
                                  •     The dead network A can be represented by a single equivalent resis-
                                        tance RTH , which we will call the Thévenin equivalent resistance.
                               SECTION 5.3 THÉVENIN AND NORTON EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS   145

     This holds true whether or not dependent sources exist in the inactive
     A network, an idea we will explore shortly.
•    A Thévenin equivalent consists of two components: a voltage source
     in series with a resistance. Either may be zero, although this is not
     usually the case.


Norton’s Theorem
Norton’s theorem bears a close resemblance to Thévenin’s theorem and
may be stated as follows:


    A Statement of Norton’s Theorem
    1. Given any linear circuit, rearrange it in the form of two
       networks, A and B, connected by two wires. Network A is the
       network to be simplified; B will be left untouched. As before, if
       either network contains a dependent source, its controlling
       variable must be in the same network.
    2. Disconnect network B, and short the terminals of A. Define
       a current isc as the current now flowing through the shorted
       terminals of network A.
    3. Turn off or “zero out” every independent source in network
       A to form an inactive network. Leave dependent sources
       unchanged.
    4. Connect an independent current source with value isc in
       parallel with the inactive network. Do not complete the circuit;
       leave the two terminals disconnected.
    5. Connect network B to the terminals of the new network A.
       All currents and voltages in B will remain unchanged.


      The Norton equivalent of a linear network is the Norton current source
i sc in parallel with the Thévenin resistance RTH . Thus, we see that in fact it
is possible to obtain the Norton equivalent of a network by performing a
source transformation on the Thévenin equivalent. This results in a direct
relationship between voc , i sc , and RTH :

                                voc = RTH i sc                               [18]

   In circuits containing dependent sources, we will often find it more con-
venient to determine either the Thévenin or Norton equivalent by finding
both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current and then deter-
mining the value of RTH as their quotient. It is therefore advisable to be-
come adept at finding both open-circuit voltages and short-circuit currents,
even in the simple problems that follow. If the Thévenin and Norton equiv-
alents are determined independently, Eq. [18] can serve as a useful check.
   Let’s consider three different examples of the determination of a
Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit.

                 From the wording of the problem statement, network B is the 1 k
                 resistor, so network A is everything else.
                    Choosing to find the Thévenin equivalent of network A first, we
                 apply superposition, noting that no current flows through the 3 k
                 resistor once network B is disconnected. With the current source set
                 to zero, Voc|4 V  4 V. With the voltage source set to zero,

                          Voc|2 mA  (0.002)(2000)  4 V. Thus, Voc  4  4  8 V.

                    To find RTH, set both sources to zero as in Fig. 5.29b. By inspection,
                 RTH  2 k  3 k  5 k. The complete Thévenin equivalent, with
                 network B reconnected, is shown in Fig. 5.29c.
                    The Norton equivalent is found by a simple source transformation of
                 the Thévenin equivalent, resulting in a current source of 8/5000  1.6 mA
                 in parallel with a 5 k resistor (Fig. 5.29d).

                 moving the 1 k resistor and shorting the terminals of network A, we

When Dependent Sources Are Present
Technically speaking, there does not always have to be a “network B” for us
to invoke either Thévenin’s theorem or Norton’s theorem; we could instead
be asked to find the equivalent of a network with two terminals not yet con-
nected to another network. If there is a network B that we do not want to in-
volve in the simplification procedure, however, we must use a little caution
if it contains dependent sources. In such situations, the controlling variable
and the associated element(s) must be included in network B and excluded
from network A. Otherwise, there will be no way to analyze the final circuit
because the controlling quantity will be lost.
     If network A contains a dependent source, then again we must ensure
that the controlling variable and its associated element(s) cannot be in net-
work B. Up to now, we have only considered circuits with resistors and in-
dependent sources. Although technically speaking it is correct to leave a
dependent source in the “inactive” network when creating a Thévenin or
Norton equivalent, in practice this does not result in any kind of simplifica-
tion. What we really want is an independent voltage source in series with a
single resistor, or an independent current source in parallel with a single
resistor—in other words, a two-component equivalent. In the following
examples, we consider various means of reducing networks with dependent
sources and resistors into a single resistance.

                                     To find Voc we note that vx = Voc and that the dependent source current
                                     must pass through the 2 k resistor, since no current can flow through
                                     the 3 k resistor. Using KVL around the outer loop:

                                          By Thévenin’s theorem, then, the equivalent circuit could be formed
                                     with the inactive A network in series with an 8 V source, as shown in
                                     Fig. 5.31b. This is correct, but not very simple and not very helpful;
                                     in the case of linear resistive networks, we really want a simpler
                                     equivalent for the inactive A network, namely, RTH .
                                          The dependent source prevents us from determining RTH directly for
                                     the inactive network through resistance combination; we therefore seek
                                     Isc . Upon short-circuiting the output terminals in Fig. 5.31a, it is
                                     apparent that Vx = 0 and the dependent current source is not active.
                                     Hence, Isc = 4/(5 × 103 ) = 0.8 mA. Thus,
                                                                 Voc         8

   As another example, let us consider a network having a dependent
source but no independent source.

 The rightmost terminals are already open-circuited, hence i = 0.
 Consequently, the dependent source is inactive, so voc = 0.
    We next seek the value of RTH represented by this two-terminal
 network. However, we cannot find voc and i sc and take their quotient,
 for there is no independent source in the network and both voc and i sc
 are zero. Let us, therefore, be a little tricky.
    We apply a 1 A source externally, measure the voltage vtest that
 results, and then set RTH = vtest /1. Referring to Fig. 5.33b, we see
 that i = −1 A. Applying nodal analysis,
                              vtest − 1.5(−1) vtest

 and thus
                                      RTH = 0.6 
 The Thévenin equivalent is shown in Fig. 5.33c.




A Quick Recap of Procedures
We have now looked at three examples in which we determined a Thévenin
or Norton equivalent circuit. The first example (Fig. 5.29) contained only
independent sources and resistors, and several different methods could have
been applied to it. One would involve calculating RTH for the inactive
network and then Voc for the live network. We could also have found RTH
and Isc , or Voc and Isc .

    From our discussion of Thévenin and Norton equiva-            of the voltmeter introduces a small error in the measured
lents, it may now be apparent that the DMM has its own            value.




                                                    In the second example (Fig. 5.31), both independent and dependent
                                               sources were present, and the method we used required us to find Voc and
                                               Isc . We could not easily find RTH for the inactive network because the
                                               dependent source could not be made inactive.
                                                    The last example did not contain any independent sources, and therefore
                                               the Thévenin and Norton equivalents do not contain an independent source.
                                               We found RTH by applying 1 A and finding vtest = 1 × RTH . We could also
                                               apply 1 V and determine i = 1/RTH . These two related techniques can be
                                               applied to any circuit with dependent sources, as long as all independent
                                               sources are set to zero first.
                                                    Two other methods have a certain appeal because they can be used for
                                               any of the three types of networks considered. In the first, simply replace
                                               network B with a voltage source vs , define the current leaving its positive

    We could also apply a current source i s , let its voltage be v, and then de-
termine i s = cv − d, where c = 1/RTH and d = i sc (the minus sign arises
from assuming both current source arrows are directed into the same node).
Both of these last two procedures are universally applicable, but some other
method can usually be found that is easier and more rapid.
    Although we are devoting our attention almost entirely to the analysis of
linear circuits, it is good to know that Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are
both valid if network B is nonlinear; only network A must be linear.

                                                      voltage and current sources, we have therefore proved the following
                                                      maximum power transfer theorem:
                                                           An independent voltage source in series with a resistance Rs , or an independent
                                                           current source in parallel with a resistance Rs , delivers maximum power to a
                                                           load resistance R L such that R L = Rs .

                                                         An alternative way to view the maximum power theorem is possible in
                                                      terms of the Thévenin equivalent resistance of a network:
                                                           A network delivers maximum power to a load resistance R L when R L is equal
                                                           to a the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network.

                                                          Thus, the maximum power transfer theorem tells us that a 2  resistor
                                                      draws the greatest power (4.5 W) from either practical source of Fig. 5.16,
                                                      whereas a resistance of 0.01  receives the maximum power (3.6 kW) in
                                                      Fig. 5.11.
                                                          There is a distinct difference between drawing maximum power from a
                                                      source and delivering maximum power to a load. If the load is sized such
                                                      that its Thévenin resistance is equal to the Thévenin resistance of the net-
                                                      work to which it is connected, it will receive maximum power from that
                                                      network. Any change to the load resistance will reduce the power delivered
                                                      to the load. However, consider just the Thévenin equivalent of the network
                                                      itself. We draw the maximum possible power from the voltage source by
                                                      drawing the maximum possible current—which is achieved by shorting the
                                                      network terminals! However, in this extreme example we deliver zero
                                                      power to the “load”—a short circuit in this case—as p = i 2 R, and we just
                                                      set R = 0 by shorting the network terminals.

where vTH and RTH recognize that the practical voltage source of Fig. 5.40
can also be viewed as a Thévenin equivalent of some specific source.
    It is also not uncommon for the maximum power theorem to be misin-
terpreted. It is designed to help us select an optimum load in order to maxi-
mize power absorption. If the load resistance is already specified, however,
the maximum power theorem is of no assistance. If for some reason we can
affect the size of the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network con-
nected to our load, setting it equal to the load does not guarantee maximum
power transfer to our predetermined load. A quick consideration of the
power lost in the Thévenin resistance will clarify this point.

                                                                                                     EXAMPLE 5.11
 The circuit shown in Fig. 5.41 is a model for the common-emitter
 bipolar junction transistor amplifier. Choose a load resistance so
 that maximum power is transferred to it from the amplifier, and
 calculate the actual power absorbed.

 Since it is the load resistance we are asked to determine, the maximum
 power theorem applies. The first step is to find the Thévenin equivalent
 of the rest of the circuit.
    We first determine the Thévenin equivalent resistance, which
 requires that we remove RL and short-circuit the independent source

          Since vπ = 0, the dependent current source is an open circuit, and
       RTH  1 k. This can be verified by connecting an independent 1 A
       current source across the 1 k resistor; vπ will still be zero, so the
       dependent source remains inactive and hence contributes nothing
       to RTH .
          In order to obtain maximum power delivered into the load, RL
       should be set to RTH = 1 k.
          To find vTH we consider the circuit shown in Fig. 5.42b, which is
       Fig. 5.41 with RL removed. We may write
                                     voc = −0.03vπ (1000) = −30vπ
       where the voltage vπ may be found from simple voltage division:
                                                            
                                                     3864
                     vπ = (2.5 × 10−3 sin 440t)
                                                  300 + 3864
       so that our Thévenin equivalent is a voltage −69.6 sin 440t mV in
       series with 1 k.
          The maximum power is given by
                                v2

      5.5 DELTA-WYE CONVERSION
           •
      We saw previously that identifying parallel and series combinations of re-
      sistors can often lead to a significant reduction in the complexity of a circuit.
      In situations where such combinations do not exist, we can often make use
      of source transformations to enable such simplifications. There is another
      useful technique, called -Y (delta-wye) conversion, that arises out of net-
      work theory.
          Consider the circuits in Fig. 5.44. There are no series or parallel combi-
      nations that can be made to further simplify any of the circuits (note that
      5.44a and 5.44b are identical, as are 5.44c and 5.44d), and without any

5.6 SELECTING AN APPROACH: A SUMMARY
   • OF VARIOUS TECHNIQUES
In Chap. 3, we were introduced to Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL). These two laws apply to any circuit we will
ever encounter, provided that we take care to consider the entire system that
the circuits represent. The reason for this is that KCL and KVL enforce
charge and energy conservation, respectively, which are fundamental prin-
ciples. Based on KCL, we developed the very powerful method of nodal
analysis. A similar technique based on KVL (unfortunately only applicable
to planar circuits) is known as mesh analysis and is also a useful circuit
analysis approach.
    For the most part, this text is concerned with developing analytical skills
that apply to linear circuits. If we know a circuit is constructed of only lin-
ear components (in other words, all voltages and currents are related by
linear functions), then we can often simplify circuits prior to employing
either mesh or nodal analysis. Perhaps the most important result that comes
from the knowledge that we are dealing with a completely linear system is
that the principle of superposition applies: given a number of independent
sources acting on our circuit, we can add the contribution of each source
independently of the other sources. This technique is extremely pervasive
throughout the field of engineering, and we will encounter it often. In many
real situations, we will find that although several “sources’’ are acting
simultaneously on our “system,’’ typically one of them dominates the system
response. Superposition allows us to quickly identify that source, provided
that we have a reasonably accurate linear model of the system.
    However, from a circuit analysis standpoint, unless we are asked to find
which independent source contributes the most to a particular response, we
find that rolling up our sleeves and launching straight into either nodal or
mesh analysis is often a more straightforward tactic. The reason for this is
that applying superposition to a circuit with 12 independent sources will
require us to redraw the original circuit 12 times, and often we will have to
apply nodal or mesh analysis to each partial circuit, anyway.
    The technique of source transformations, on the other hand, is often a
very useful tool in circuit analysis. Performing source transformations can
allow us to consolidate resistors or sources that are not in series or parallel
in the original circuit. Source transformations may also allow us to convert
all or at least most of the sources in the original circuit to the same type
(either all voltage sources or all current sources), so nodal or mesh analysis
is more straightforward.
    Thévenin’s theorem is extremely important for a number of reasons. In
working with electronic circuits, we are always aware of the Thévenin
equivalent resistance of different parts of our circuit, especially the input
and output resistances of amplifier stages. The reason for this is that match-
ing of resistances is frequently the best route to optimizing the performance
of a given circuit. We have seen a small preview of this in our discussion of
maximum power transfer, where the load resistance should be chosen to
match the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network to which the load
is connected. In terms of day-to-day circuit analysis, however, we find that
converting part of a circuit to its Thévenin or Norton equivalent is almost as
much work as analyzing the complete circuit. Therefore, as in the case of
158   CHAPTER 5 HANDY CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES


      superposition, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are typically applied only
      when we require specialized information about part of our circuit.


      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      Although we asserted in Chap. 4 that nodal analysis and mesh analysis are
      sufficient to analyze any circuit we might encounter (provided we have the
      means to relate voltage and current for any passive element, such as Ohm’s
      law for resistors), the simple truth is that often we do not really need all
      voltages, or all currents. Sometimes, it is simply one element, or a small
      portion of a larger circuit, that has our attention. Perhaps there is some un-
      certainty in the final value of a particular element, and we’d like to see how
      the circuit performs over the range of expected values. In such instances, we
      can exploit the fact that at the moment we have confined ourselves to linear
      circuits. This allows the development of other tools: superposition, where
      individual contributions of sources can be identified; source transforma-
      tions, where a voltage source in series with a resistor can be replaced with a
      current source in parallel with a resistor; and the most powerful of all—
      Thévenin (and Norton) equivalents.
          An interesting offshoot of these topics is the idea of maximum power
      transfer. Assuming we can represent our (arbitrarily complex) circuit by
      two networks, one passive and one active, maximum power transfer to the
      passive network is achieved when its Thévenin resistance is equal to the
      Thévenin resistance of the active network. Finally, we introduced the con-
      cept of delta-wye conversion, a process that allows us to simplify some re-
      sistive networks which at face value are not reducible using standard series-
      parallel combination techniques.
          We are still faced with the perpetual question, “Which tool should I use
      to analyze this circuit?” The answer typically lies in the type of information
      required about our circuit. Experience will eventually guide us a bit, but it
      is not always true that there is one “best” approach. Certainly one issue to
      focus on is whether one or more components might be changed—this can
      suggest whether superposition, a Thévenin equivalent, or a partial simplifi-
      cation such as can be achieved with source or delta-wye transformation is
      the most practical route.
          We conclude this chapter by reviewing key points, along with identify-
      ing relevant example(s).
      ❑ The principle of superposition states that the response in a linear
          circuit can be obtained by adding the individual responses caused
          by the separate independent sources acting alone. (Examples 5.1,
          5.2, 5.3)
      ❑ Superposition is most often used when it is necessary to determine the
          individual contribution of each source to a particular response.
          (Examples 5.2, 5.3)
      ❑ A practical model for a real voltage source is a resistor in series with an
          independent voltage source. A practical model for a real current source
          is a resistor in parallel with an independent current source.
      ❑ Source transformations allow us to convert a practical voltage source
          into a practical current source, and vice versa. (Example 5.4)
                                                                           EXERCISES   159

❑   Repeated source transformations can greatly simplify analysis of a
    circuit by providing the means to combine resistors and sources.
    (Example 5.5)
❑   The Thévenin equivalent of a network is a resistor in series with an
    independent voltage source. The Norton equivalent is the same resistor
    in parallel with an independent current source. (Example 5.6)
❑   There are several ways to obtain the Thévenin equivalent resistance,
    depending on whether or not dependent sources are present in the
    network. (Examples 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10)
❑   Maximum power transfer occurs when the load resistor matches the
    Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network to which it is connected.
    (Example 5.11)
❑   When faced with a Δ-connected resistor network, it is straightforward
    to convert it to a Y-connected network. This can be useful in simplify-
    ing the network prior to analysis. Conversely, a Y-connected resistor
    network can be converted to a Δ-connected network to assist in
    simplification of the network. (Example 5.12)

EXERCISES
5.1 Linearity and Superposition
 1. Linear systems are so easy to work with that engineers often construct linear
    models of real (nonlinear) systems to assist in analysis and design. Such mod-
    els are often surprisingly accurate over a limited range. For example, consider
    the simple exponential function e x . The Taylor series representation of this
    function is
                                           x2   x3
                            ex ≈ 1 + x +      +    + ···

         expansion after the linear term. (b) Evaluate your model function at
         x = 0.000001, 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0. (c) For which values of x does
         your model yield a “reasonable” approximation to e x ? Explain your
         reasoning.
 2. Construct a linear approximation to the function y(t) = 4 sin 2t . (a) Evaluate
    your approximation at t = 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0. (b) For which values
    of t does your model provide a “reasonable” approximation to the actual
    (nonlinear) function y(t)? Explain your reasoning.
 3. Considering the circuit of Fig. 5.48, employ superposition to determine the two
    components of i 8 arising from the action of the two independent sources,
    respectively.

    Fig. 5.106. Unfortunately, the power delivered to the load is only 50% of the
    required amount. Altering only voltage sources, modify the circuit so that the

71. Three 45 W light bulbs originally wired in a Y network configuration with a
    120 V ac source connected across each port are rewired as a  network. The
    neutral, or center, connection is not used. If the intensity of each light is pro-
    portional to the power it draws, design a new 120 V ac power circuit so that
    the three lights have the same intensity in the  configuration as they did
    when connected in a Y configuration. Verify your design using PSpice by
    comparing the power drawn by each light in your circuit (modeled as an
    appropriately chosen resistor value) with the power each would draw in

      74. A certain red LED has a maximum current rating of 35 mA, and if this value
          is exceeded, overheating and catastrophic failure will result. The resistance
          of the LED is a nonlinear function of its current, but the manufacturer war-
          rants a minimum resistance of 47  and a maximum resistance of 117 .
          Only 9 V batteries are available to power the LED. Design a suitable circuit
          to deliver the maximum power possible to the LED without damaging it.

          15 mA at 6 V, design a circuit with no moving parts that will set off the
          buzzer if the window is broken (and hence the thin wire as well). Note that
          the buzzer requires a dc voltage of at least 6 V (maximum 28 V) to operate.

          At this point we have a good set of circuit analysis tools at our dis-
          posal, but have focused primarily on somewhat general circuits            Inverting and Noninverting
          composed of only sources and resistors. In this chapter, we intro-        Amplifiers
          duce a new component which, although technically nonlinear, can
          be treated effectively with linear models. This element, known as         Summing and Difference
          the operational amplifier or op amp for short, finds daily usage in a     Amplifier Circuits
          large variety of electronic applications. It also provides us a new
          element to use in building circuits, and another opportunity to test      Cascaded Op Amp Stages
          out our developing analytical skills.
                                                                                    Using Op Amps to Build

          6.1 BACKGROUND
               •
          The origins of the operational amplifier date to the 1940s, when          Nonideal Characteristics of
          basic circuits were constructed using vacuum tubes to perform             Op Amps
          mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplica-
          tion, division, differentiation, and integration. This enabled the con-
          struction of analog (as opposed to digital) computers tasked with the     Voltage Gain and Feedback
          solution of complex differential equations. The first commercially
          available op amp device is generally considered to be the K2-W,           Basic Comparator and
          manufactured by Philbrick Researches, Inc. of Boston from about           Instrumentation Amplifier
          1952 through the early 1970s (Fig. 6.1a). These early vacuum              Circuits
          tube devices weighed 3 oz (85 g), measured 133/64 in × 29/64 in ×
          47/64 in (3.8 cm × 5.4 cm × 10.4 cm), and sold for about US$22.
          In contrast, integrated circuit (IC) op amps such as the Fairchild
          KA741 weigh less than 500 mg, measure 5.7 mm × 4.9 mm ×
          1.8 mm, and sell for approximately US$0.22.
              Compared to op amps based on vacuum tubes, modern IC op
          amps are constructed using perhaps 25 or more transistors all on the
          same silicon “chip,” as well as resistors and capacitors needed to ob-
          tain the desired performance characteristics. As a result, they run at

                        (a)                            this point, we are not concerned with the internal circuitry of the op amp or the

                                                              •
                                                       In practice, we find that most op amps perform so well that we can often
                                                       make the assumption that we are dealing with an “ideal” op amp. The char-
                                                       acteristics of an ideal op amp form the basis for two fundamental rules that
                                                       at first may seem somewhat unusual:

                                                           Ideal Op Amp Rules
                                                           1. No current ever flows into either input terminal.
                                                           2. There is no voltage difference between the two input terminals.

                                                           In a real op amp, a very small leakage current will flow into the input
                                                       (sometimes as low as 40 femtoamperes). It is also possible to obtain a very
                                                       small voltage across the two input terminals. However, compared to other
                                                       voltages and currents in most circuits, such values are so small that includ-
                                                       ing them in the analysis does not typically affect our calculations.
                                                           When analyzing op amp circuits, we should keep one other point in mind.
                                                       As opposed to the circuits that we have studied so far, an op amp circuit al-
                                                       ways has an output that depends on some type of input. Therefore, we will an-
                                                       alyze op amp circuits with the goal of obtaining an expression for the output
                                                       in terms of the input quantities. We will find that it is usually a good idea to
                                                       begin the analysis of an op amp circuit at the input, and proceed from there.

   The circuit shown in Fig. 6.3 is known as an inverting amplifier. We                                                                          Rf       i

                                   vout = vin − (R1 + R f )i                              [1]       through the output pin of the op amp.

    Given vin = 5 sin 3t mV, R1  4.7 k, and Rf  47 k, we require one
additional equation that expresses i only in terms of vout, vin, R1, and/or Rf.
    This is a good time to mention that we have not yet made use of ideal
op amp rule 2. Since the noninverting input is grounded, it is at zero volts.
By ideal op amp rule 2, the inverting input is therefore also at zero volts!
This does not mean that the two inputs are physically shorted together, and
we should be careful not to make such an assumption. Rather, the two input
voltages simply track each other: if we try to change the voltage at one pin,
the other pin will be driven by internal circuitry to the same value. Thus, we
can write one more KVL equation:
                                      −vin + R1 i + 0 = 0
                                                                                                          The fact that the inverting input terminal finds itself at

 Ans: vout = vin . The circuit is known as a “voltage follower,” since the output
 voltage tracks or “follows” the input voltage.                                                          ■ FIGURE 6.8




    Just like the inverting amplifier, the noninverting amplifier works with
dc as well as ac inputs, but has a voltage gain of vout /vin = 1 + (R f /R1 ).
Thus, if we set R f = 9  and R1 = 1 , we obtain an output vout which is
10 times larger than the input voltage vin . In contrast to the inverting ampli-
fier, the output and input of the noninverting amplifier always have the same
sign, and the output voltage cannot be less than the input; the minimum gain
is 1. Which amplifier we choose depends on the application we are consid-
ering. In the special case of the voltage follower circuit shown in Fig. 6.8,
180             CHAPTER 6 THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER


                which represents a noninverting amplifier with R1 set to ∞ and R f set to
                zero, the output is identical to the input in both sign and magnitude. This
                may seem rather pointless as a general type of circuit, but we should keep in
                mind that the voltage follower draws no current from the input (in the ideal
                case)—it therefore can act as a buffer between the voltage vin and some re-
                sistive load R L connected to the output of the op amp.
                    We mentioned earlier that the name “operational amplifier” originates
                from using such devices to perform arithmetical operations on analog (i.e.,
                nondigitized, real-time, real-world) signals. As we see in the following two
                circuits, this includes both addition and subtraction of input voltage signals.

                           ■ FIGURE 6.9 Basic summing amplifier circuit with three inputs.

                 We first note that this circuit is similar to the inverting amplifier circuit
                 of Fig. 6.3. Again, the goal is to obtain an expression for vout (which
                 in this case appears across a load resistor R L ) in terms of the inputs
                 (v1 , v2 , and v3 ).
                     Since no current can flow into the inverting input terminal, we can
                 write
                                                    i = i1 + i2 + i3
                     Therefore, we can write the following equation at the node labeled va :
                                      va − vout   va − v1   va − v2   va − v3
                                0=              +         +         +

                    This equation contains both vout and the input voltages, but unfortu-
                 nately it also contains the nodal voltage va . To remove this unknown
                 quantity from our expression, we need to write an additional equation
                 that relates va to vout , the input voltages, R f , and/or R. At this point, we
                 remember that we have not yet used ideal op amp rule 2, and that we
                 will almost certainly require the use of both rules when analyzing an
                 op amp circuit. Thus, since va = vb = 0, we can write the following:
                                                    vout   v1   v2   v3

                                                    Rf     R    R    R
                                      SECTION 6.2 THE IDEAL OP AMP: A CORDIAL INTRODUCTION   181


    Rearranging, we obtain the following expression for vout :
                                 Rf
                        vout = − (v1 + v2 + v3 )                       [6]
                                 R
    In the special case where v2 = v3 = 0, we see that our result agrees
 with Eq. [3], which was derived for essentially the same circuit.


     There are several interesting features about the result we have just de-
rived. First, if we select Rf so that it is equal to R, then the output is the (neg-
ative of the) sum of the three input signals v1, v2, and v3. Further, we can select
the ratio of Rf to R to multiply this sum by a fixed constant. So, for exam-
ple, if the three voltages represented signals from three separate scales cal-
ibrated so that −1 V  1 lb, we could set R f = R/2.205 to obtain a voltage
signal that represented the combined weight in kilograms (to within about
1 percent accuracy due to our conversion factor).
     Also, we notice that RL did not appear in our final expression. As long as its
value is not too low, the operation of the circuit will not be affected; at present,
we have not considered a detailed enough model of an op amp to predict such
an occurrence. This resistor represents the Thévenin equivalent of whatever we
use to monitor the amplifier output. If our output device is a simple voltmeter,
then RL represents the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen looking into the
voltmeter terminals (typically 10 M or more). Or, our output device might
be a speaker (typically 8 ), in which case we hear the sum of the three sepa-
rate sources of sound; v1, v2, and v3 might represent microphones in that case.
     One word of caution: It is frequently tempting to assume that the current
labeled i in Fig. 6.9 flows not only through Rf but through RL also. Not true!
It is very possible that current is flowing through the output terminal of the
op amp as well, so that the currents through the two resistors are not the
same. It is for this reason that we almost universally avoid writing KCL
equations at the output pin of an op amp, which leads to the preference of
nodal over mesh analysis when working with most op amp circuits.
     For convenience, we summarize the most common op amp circuits in
Table 1.

                                            We have already analyzed each of these op amp circuits separately.
                                         Based on our previous experience, if the two op amp circuits were discon-
                                         nected, we would expect
                                                                                           Rf

                                                                                           R

                                                                                   vout = −           vx                          [8]

                                             In fact, since the two circuits are connected at a single point and the
                                         voltage vx is not influenced by the connection, we can combine Eqs. [7] and
                                         [8] to obtain
                                                                                      R2 R f

which describes the input-output characteristics of the circuit shown in
Fig. 6.15. We may not always be able to reduce such a circuit to familiar
stages, however, so it is worth seeing how the two-stage circuit of Fig. 6.15
can be analyzed as a whole.
    When analyzing cascaded circuits, it is sometimes helpful to begin with
the last stage and work backward toward the input stage. Referring to ideal
op amp rule 1, the same current flows through R1 and R2. Writing the appro-
priate nodal equation at the node labeled vc yields

                               vc − vx   vc − vout
                          0=           +                                     [10]
                                  R1        R2

   Applying ideal op amp rule 2, we can set vc = 0 in Eq. [10], resulting in

                                    vx   vout
                               0=      +                                     [11]
                                    R1    R2

    Since our goal is an expression for vout in terms of v1 and v2 , we proceed
to the first op amp in order to obtain an expression for vx in terms of the two
input quantities.
    Applying ideal op amp rule 1 at the inverting input of the first op amp,

                         va − vx   va − v1   va − v2
                    0=           +         +                                 [12]
                            Rf        R         R

   Ideal op amp rule 2 allows us to replace va in Eq. [12] with zero, since
va = vb = 0. Thus, Eq. [12] becomes

                                   vx   v1   v2
                            0=        +    +                                 [13]
                                   Rf   R    R

    We now have an equation for vout in terms of vx (Eq. [11]), and an equa-
tion for vx in terms of v1 and v2 (Eq. [13]). These equations are identical to
Eqs. [7] and [8], respectively, which means that cascading the two separate
circuits as in Fig. 6.15 did not affect the input-output relationship of either
stage. Combining Eqs. [11] and [13], we find that the input-output relation-
ship for the cascaded op amp circuit is

                                   R2 R f
                          vout =          (v1 + v2 )                         [14]
                                   R1 R

which is identical to Eq. [9].
    Thus, the cascaded circuit acts as a summing amplifier, but without a
phase reversal between the input and output. By choosing the resistor val-
ues carefully, we can either amplify or attenuate the sum of the two input
voltages. If we select R2 = R1 and R f = R, we can also obtain an amplifier
circuit where vout = v1 + v2 , if desired.

  EXAMPLE 6.3
                 A multiple-tank gas propellant fuel system is installed in a small
                 lunar orbit runabout. The amount of fuel in any tank is monitored
                 by measuring the tank pressure (in psia).2 Technical details for
                 tank capacity as well as sensor pressure and voltage range are
                 given in Table 6.2. Design a circuit which provides a positive dc
                 voltage signal proportional to the total fuel remaining, such that

                 We see from Table 6.2 that the system has three separate gas tanks,
                 requiring three separate sensors. Each sensor is rated up to 12,500 psia,
                 with a corresponding output of 5 V. Thus, when tank 1 is full, its sensor
                 will provide a voltage signal of 5 × (10,000/12,500) = 4 V; the
                 same is true for the sensor monitoring tank 2. The sensor connected
                 to tank 3, however, will only provide a maximum voltage signal of
                 5 × (200012,500)  800 mV.
                     One possible solution is the circuit shown in Fig. 6.16a, which em-
                 ploys a summing amplifier stage with v1, v2, and v3 representing the
                 three sensor outputs, followed by an inverting amplifier to adjust the
                 voltage sign and magnitude. Since we are not told the output resistance
                 of the sensor, we employ a buffer for each one as shown in Fig. 6.16b;
                 the result is (in the ideal case) no current flow from the sensor.
                     To keep the design as simple as possible, we begin by choosing
                 R1, R2 , R3 , and R4 to be 1 k; any value will do as long as all four
                 resistors are equal. Thus, the output of the summing stage is

                                                    vx = −(v1 + v2 + v3 )

                    The final stage must invert this voltage and scale it such that the
                 output voltage is 1 V when all three tanks are full. The full condition
                 results in vx = −(4 + 4 + 0.8) = −8.8 V. Thus, the final stage needs
                 a voltage ratio of R6 /R5 = 1/8.8. Arbitrarily choosing R6 = 1 k, we
                 find that a value of 8.8 k for R5 completes the design.

               In this and previous chapters we have often made use of ideal current and volt-
               age sources, which we assume provide the same value of current or voltage, re-
               spectively, regardless of how they are connected in a circuit. Our assumption
               of independence has its limits, of course, as mentioned in Sec. 5.2 when we
               discussed practical sources which included a “built-in” or inherent resistance.
               The effect of such a resistance was a reduction of the voltage output of a volt-
               age source as more current was demanded, or a diminished current output as
               more voltage was required from a current source. As discussed in this section, it
               is possible to construct circuits with more reliable characteristics using op amps.

               A Reliable Voltage Source
               One of the most common means of providing a stable and consistent refer-
               ence voltage is to make use of a nonlinear device known as a Zener diode.
               Its symbol is a triangle with a Z-like line across the top of the triangle, as
               shown for a 1N750 in the circuit of Fig. 6.18a. Diodes are characterized by

a strongly asymmetric current-voltage relationship. For small voltages, they
either conduct essentially zero current—or experience an exponentially in-
creasing current—depending on the voltage polarity. In this way, they dis-
tinguish themselves from the simple resistor, where the magnitude of the
current is the same for either voltage polarity and hence the resistor current-
voltage relationship is symmetric. Consequently, the terminals of a diode
are not interchangeable, and have unique names: the anode (the flat part of
the triangle) and the cathode (the point of the triangle).
    A Zener diode is a special type of diode designed to be used with a positive
voltage at the cathode with respect to the anode; when connected this way, the
diode is said to be reverse biased. For low voltages, the diode acts like a resis-
tor with a small linear increase in current flow as the voltage is increased. Once
a certain voltage (VBR) is reached, however—known as the reverse breakdown
voltage or Zener voltage of the diode—the voltage does not significantly in-
crease further, but essentially any current can flow up to the maximum rating
of the diode (75 mA for a 1N750, whose Zener voltage is 4.7 V).
    Let’s consider the simulation result presented in Fig. 6.18b, which shows
the voltage Vref across the diode as the voltage source V1 is swept from 0 to
20 V. Provided V1 remains above 5 V, the voltage across our diode is es-
sentially constant. Thus, we could replace V1 with a 9 V battery, and not be
too concerned with changes in our voltage reference as the battery voltage
begins to drop as it discharges. The purpose of R1 in this circuit is simply to
provide the necessary voltage drop between the battery and the diode; its
value should be chosen to ensure that the diode is operating at its Zener volt-
age but below its maximum rated current. For example, Fig. 6.18c shows
that the 75 mA rating is exceeded in our circuit if the source voltage V1 is
much greater than 12 V. Thus, the value of resistor R1 should be sized cor-
responding to the source voltage available, as we explore in Example 6.4.


                                                                                      EXAMPLE 6.4
 Design a circuit based on the 1N750 Zener diode that runs on a
 single 9 V battery and provides a reference voltage of 4.7 V.
 The 1N750 has a maximum current rating of 75 mA, and a Zener volt-
 age of 4.7 V. The voltage of a 9 V battery can vary slightly depending
 on its state of charge, but we neglect this for the present design.
    A simple circuit such as the one shown in Fig. 6.19a is adequate
 for our purposes; the only issue is determining a suitable value for the
 resistor Rref.
    If 4.7 V is dropped across the diode, then 9 − 4.7 = 4.3 V must be
 dropped across Rref. Thus,
                                     9 − Vref   4.3
                            Rref =            =
                                       Iref     Iref
    We determine Rref by specifying a current value. We know that Iref
 should not be allowed to exceed 75 mA for this diode, and large currents
 will discharge the battery more quickly. However, as seen in Fig. 6.19b,
 we cannot simply select Iref arbitrarily; very low currents do not allow
                                                         (Continued on next page)

                                                            pass is reasonably close (within 1 percent) to our target value.


                                                               The basic Zener diode voltage reference circuit of Fig. 6.18a works very
                                                           well in many situations, but we are limited somewhat in the value of the volt-
                                                           age depending on which Zener diodes are available. Also, we often find that
                                                           the circuit shown is not well suited to applications requiring more than a few
                                                           milliamperes of current. In such instances, we may use the Zener reference
                                                           circuit in conjunction with a simple amplifier stage, as shown in Fig. 6.20.

    In other words, the current supplied to RL does not depend on its
resistance—the primary attribute of an ideal current source. It is also worth
noting that we are not tapping the output voltage of the op amp here as a quan-
tity of interest. Instead, we may view the load resistor RL as the Norton (or
Thévenin) equivalent of some unknown passive load circuit, which receives
power from the op amp circuit. Redrawing the circuit slightly as in Fig. 6.21b,
we see that it has a great deal in common with the more familiar circuit of
Fig. 6.21c. In other words, we may use this op amp circuit as an independent
current source with essentially ideal characteristics, up to the maximum rated
output current of the op amp selected.

between the open-loop voltage gain of the op amp itself, and the closed-
loop voltage gain that characterizes a particular op amp circuit. The “loop”
in this case refers to an external path between the output pin and the invert-
ing input pin; it can be a wire, a resistor, or another type of element, de-
pending on the application.
    The μA741 is a very common op amp, originally produced by Fairchild
Corporation in 1968. It is characterized by an open-loop voltage gain of
200,000, an input resistance of 2 M, and an output resistance of 75 . In
order to evaluate how well the ideal op amp model approximates the be-
havior of this particular device, let’s revisit the inverting amplifier circuit of
Fig. 6.3.


                                                                                                                     EXAMPLE 6.6
 Using the appropriate values for the μA741 op amp in the model of
 Fig. 6.24, reanalyze the inverting amplifier circuit of Fig. 6.3.
 We begin by replacing the ideal op amp symbol of Fig. 6.3 with the
 detailed model, resulting in the circuit shown in Fig. 6.25.
 Note that we can no longer invoke the ideal op amp rules, since we are
 not using the ideal op amp model. Thus, we write two nodal equations:
                           −vd − vin    −vd − vout   −vd
                        0=            +            +
                                R1           Rf       Ri
                           vout + vd   vout − Avd
                        0=           +
                               Rf           Ro
 Performing some straightforward but rather lengthy algebra, we elimi-
 nate vd and combine these two equations to obtain the following
                                                                         (Continued on next page)

       Ri = 2 M, and A = 2 × 105 , we obtain
                    vout = −9.999448vin = −49.99724 sin 3t                       mV
          Upon comparing this to the expression found assuming an ideal op
       amp (vout = −10vin = −50 sin 3t mV), we see that the ideal op amp is
       indeed a reasonably accurate model. Further, assuming an ideal op amp
       leads to a significant reduction in the algebra required to perform the
       circuit analysis. Note that if we allow A → ∞, Ro → 0, and Ri → ∞,
       Eq. [15] reduces to

       Ans: vout /vin = −AR f Ri /[(1 + A)R1 Ri + R1 R f + R f Ri ].



      Derivation of the Ideal Op Amp Rules
      We have seen that the ideal op amp can be a reasonably accurate model for
      the behavior of practical devices. However, using our more detailed model
      which includes a finite open-loop gain, finite input resistance, and nonzero
      output resistance, it is actually straightforward to derive the two ideal op
      amp rules.
          Referring to Fig. 6.24, we see that the open circuit output voltage of a
      practical op amp can be expressed as
                                              vout = Avd                               [16]
                                                   SECTION 6.5 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   195

    Rearranging this equation, we find that vd , sometimes referred to as the
differential input voltage, can be written as
                                            vout
                                   vd =                                           [17]
                                             A
    As we might expect, there are practical limits to the output voltage vout
that can be obtained from a real op amp. As described in the next section, we
must connect our op amp to external dc voltage supplies in order to power the
internal circuitry. These external voltage supplies represent the maximum
value of vout, and are typically in the range of 5 to 24 V. If we divide 24 V by
the open-loop gain of the μA741 (2 × 105 ), we obtain vd = 120 μV.
Although this is not the same as zero volts, such a small value compared to
the output voltage of 24 V is practically zero. An ideal op amp would have in-
finite open-loop gain, resulting in vd = 0 regardless of vout; this leads to ideal
op amp rule 2.
    Ideal op amp rule 1 states that “No current ever flows into either input
terminal.” Referring to Fig. 6.23, the input current of an op amp is simply
                                            vd
                                   i in =
                                            Ri
    We have just determined that vd is typically a very small voltage. As we
can see from Table 6.3, the input resistance of an op amp is very large, rang-
ing from the megaohms to the teraohms! Using the value of vd = 120 μV
from above and Ri = 2 M, we compute an input current of 60 pA. This is
an extremely small current, and we would require a specialized ammeter
(known as a picoammeter) to measure it. We see from Table 6.3 that the typ-
ical input current (more accurately termed the input bias current) of a
μA741 is 80 nA, three orders of magnitude larger than our estimate. This is
a shortcoming of the op amp model we are using, which is not designed to
provide accurate values for input bias current. Compared to the other cur-
rents flowing in a typical op amp circuit, however, either value is essentially
zero. More modern op amps (such as the AD549) have even lower input
bias currents. Thus, we conclude that ideal op amp rule 1 is a fairly reason-
able assumption.
    From our discussion, it is clear that an ideal op amp has infinite open-
loop voltage gain, and infinite input resistance. However, we have not yet
considered the output resistance of the op amp and its possible effects on
our circuit. Referring to Fig. 6.24, we see that
                             vout = Avd − Ro i out
where i out flows from the output pin of the op amp. Thus, a nonzero value of
Ro acts to reduce the output voltage, an effect which becomes more pro-
nounced as the output current increases. For this reason, an ideal op amp
has an output resistance of zero ohms. The μA741 has a maximum output
resistance of 75 , and more modern devices such as the AD549 have even
lower output resistance.

Common-Mode Rejection
The op amp is occasionally referred to as a difference amplifier, since the
output is proportional to the voltage difference between the two input

                                                 Negative Feedback
                                                 We have seen that the open-loop gain of an op amp is very large, ideally in-
                                                 finite. In practical situations, however, its exact value can vary from the
                                                 value specified by the manufacturer as typical. Temperature, for example,
                                                 can have a number of significant effects on the performance of an op amp,

                                                 ferent from the behavior observed on a warm sunny day. Also, there are
                                                 typically small variations between devices fabricated at different times. If
                                                 we design a circuit in which the output voltage is the open-loop gain times
                                                 the voltage at one of the input terminals, the output voltage could therefore
                                                 be difficult to predict with a reasonable degree of precision, and might be
                                                 expected to change depending on the ambient temperature.
                                                     A solution to such potential problems is to employ the technique of
                                                 negative feedback, which is the process of subtracting a small portion of
                                                 the output from the input. If some event changes the characteristics of the
                                                 amplifier such that the output tries to increase, the input is decreasing at the
                                                 same time. Too much negative feedback will prevent any useful amplifica-
                                                 tion, but a small amount provides stability. An example of negative

feedback is the unpleasant sensation we feel as our hand draws near a
flame. The closer we move toward the flame, the larger the negative signal
sent from our hand. Overdoing the proportion of negative feedback, how-
ever, might cause us to abhor heat, and eventually freeze to death. Positive
feedback is the process where some fraction of the output signal is added
back to the input. A common example is when a microphone is directed to-
ward a speaker—a very soft sound is rapidly amplified over and over until
the system “screams.” Positive feedback generally leads to an unstable
system.
    All of the circuits considered in this chapter incorporate negative feed-
back through the presence of a resistor between the output pin and the
inverting input. The resulting loop between the output and the input reduces
the dependency of the output voltage on the actual value of the open-loop
gain (as seen in Example 6.6). This obviates the need to measure the precise
open-loop gain of each op amp we use, as small variations in A will not sig-
nificantly impact the operation of the circuit. Negative feedback also pro-
vides increased stability in situations where A is sensitive to the op amp’s
surroundings. For example, if A suddenly increases in response to a change
in the ambient temperature, a larger feedback voltage is added to the
inverting input. This acts to reduce the differential input voltage vd , and
therefore the change in output voltage Avd is smaller. We should note that the
closed-loop circuit gain is always less than the open-loop device gain;
this is the price we pay for stability and reduced sensitivity to parameter
variations.

Saturation
So far, we have treated the op amp as a purely linear device, assuming that
its characteristics are independent of the way in which it is connected in a cir-                                                            +

the PSpice simulation in Fig. 6.28, we do in fact observe linear behavior
from the op amp, but only in the range of ±1.71 V for the input voltage.
Outside of this range, the output voltage is no longer proportional to the
input, reaching a peak magnitude of 17.6 V. This important nonlinear effect
is known as saturation, which refers to the fact that further increases in the
input voltage do not result in a change in the output voltage. This phenom-
enon refers to the fact that the output of a real op amp cannot exceed its

Slew Rate
Up to now, we have tacitly assumed that the op amp will respond equally
well to signals of any frequency, although perhaps we would not be sur-
prised to find that in practice there is some type of limitation in this regard.
Since we know that op amp circuits work well at dc, which is essentially
zero frequency, it is the performance as the signal frequency is increased
that we must consider. One measure of the frequency performance of an op
amp is its slew rate, which is the rate at which the output voltage can
respond to changes in the input; it is most often expressed in V/μs. The
typical slew rate specification for several commercially available devices is
provided in Table 6.3, showing values on the order of a few volts per
microsecond. One notable exception is the OPA690, which is designed as a
high-speed op amp for video applications requiring operation at several
hundred MHz. As can be seen, a respectable slew rate of 1800 V/μs is not
unrealistic for this device, although its other parameters, particularly input
bias current and CMRR, suffer somewhat as a result.
    The PSpice simulations shown in Fig. 6.30 illustrate the degradation in
performance of an op amp due to slew rate limitations. The circuit simu-
lated is an LF411 configured as a noninverting amplifier with a gain of 2 and
powered by ±15 V supplies. The input waveform is shown in green, and has

                                                        Fig. 6.30a corresponds to a rise and fall time of 1 μs which, although a
                                                        short time span for humans, is easily coped with by the LF411. As the rise
                                                        and fall times are decreased by a factor of 10 to 100 ns (Fig. 6.30b), we
                                                        begin to see that the LF411 is having a small difficulty in tracking the input.
                                                        In the case of a 50 ns rise and fall time (Fig. 6.30c), we see that not only is
                                                        there a significant delay between the output and the input, but the waveform
                                                        is noticeably distorted as well—not a good feature of an amplifier. This ob-
                                                        served behavior is consistent with the typical slew rate of 15 V/μs specified
                                                        in Table 6.3, which indicates that the output might be expected to require
                                                        roughly 130 ns to change from 0 to 2 V (or 2 V to 0 V).

                                                        Packaging
                                                        Modern op amps are available in a number of different types of packages.
                                                        Some styles are better suited to high temperatures, and there are a variety
                                                        of different ways to mount ICs on printed-circuit boards. Figure 6.31
                                                        shows several different styles of the LM741, manufactured by National

                                                        for a large number of different integrated circuits; occasionally there are

  COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
                                                          As we have just seen, PSpice can be enormously helpful in predicting
                                                          the output of an op amp circuit, especially in the case of time-varying
                                                          inputs. We will find, however, that our ideal op amp model agrees fairly
                                                          well with PSpice simulations as a general rule.
                                                             When performing a PSpice simulation of an op amp circuit, we must
                                                          be careful to remember that positive and negative dc supplies must be
                                                          connected to the device (with the exception of the LM324, which is de-
                                                          signed to be a single-supply op amp). Although the model shows the
                                                          offset null pins used to zero the output voltage, PSpice does not build in
                                                          any offset, so these pins are typically left floating (unconnected).
                                                             Table 6.3 shows the different op amp part numbers available in the
                                                          Evaluation version of PSpice; other models are available in the com-

Simulate the circuit of Fig. 6.3 using PSpice. Determine the point(s)
at which saturation begins if ±15 V dc supplies are used to power
the device. Compare the gain calculated by PSpice to what was
predicted using the ideal op amp model.
We begin by drawing the inverting amplifier circuit of Fig. 6.3 using
the schematic capture tool as shown in Fig. 6.32. Note that two separate
15 V dc supplies are required to power the op amp.




■ FIGURE 6.32 The inverting amplifier of Fig. 6.3 drawn using a μA741 op amp.

   Our previous analysis using an ideal op amp model predicted a gain
of −10. With an input of 5 sin 3t mV, this led to an output voltage of
−50 sin 3t mV. However, an implicit assumption in the analysis was
that any voltage input would be amplified by a factor of −10. Based on
practical considerations, we expect this to be true for small input volt-
ages, but the output will eventually saturate to a value comparable to
the corresponding power supply voltage.
   We perform a dc sweep from −2 to +2 volts, as shown in Fig. 6.33;
this is a slightly larger range than the supply voltage divided by the
gain, so we expect our results to include the positive and negative
saturation regions.
   Using the cursor tool on the simulation results shown in
Fig. 6.34a, the input-output characteristic of the amplifier is indeed
linear over a wide input range, corresponding approximately to
−1.45 < Vs < +1.45 V (Fig. 6.34b): This range is slightly less than
the range defined by dividing the positive and negative supply voltages
by the gain. Outside this range, the output of the op amp saturates, with
only a slight dependence on the input voltage. In the two saturation re-
gions, then, the circuit does not perform as a linear amplifier.
   Increasing the number of cursor digits (Tools, Options, Number of
Cursor Digits) to 10, we find that at an input voltage of Vs = 1.0 V, the
                                                                  (Continued on next page)

6.6 COMPARATORS AND THE INSTRUMENTATION
   • AMPLIFIER
The Comparator
Every op amp circuit we have discussed up to now has featured an electri-
cal connection between the output pin and the inverting input pin. This is
known as closed-loop operation, and is used to provide negative feedback
as discussed previously. Closed loop is the preferred method of using an
op amp as an amplifier, as it serves to isolate the circuit performance from
variations in the open-loop gain that arise from changes in temperature or
manufacturing differences. There are a number of applications, however,
where it is advantageous to use an op amp in an open-loop configuration.
Devices intended for such applications are frequently referred to as
comparators, as they are designed slightly differently from regular op amps
in order to improve their speed in open-loop operation.
    Figure 6.35a shows a simple comparator circuit where a 2.5 V refer-
ence voltage is connected to the noninverting input, and the voltage being
compared (vin) is connected to the inverting input. Since the op amp has a
very large open-loop gain A (105 or greater, typically, as seen in Table 6.3),
it does not take a large voltage difference between the input terminals
to drive it into saturation. In fact, a differential input voltage as small as
the supply voltage divided by A is required—approximately ±120 μV in the
case of the circuit in Fig. 6.35a and A = 105 . The distinctive output of
the comparator circuit is shown in Fig. 6.35b, where the response swings

                                                         “amplification” region. Thus, a positive 12 V output from the comparator
                                                         indicates that the input voltage is less than the reference voltage, and a
                                                         negative 12 V output indicates an input voltage greater than the reference.
                                                         Opposite behavior is obtained if we connect the reference voltage to the
                                                         inverting input instead.

                                                          Since we want the output of our comparator to swing between 0 and

                                                         The Instrumentation Amplifier
                                                         The basic comparator circuit acts on the voltage difference between the two
                                                         input terminals to the device, although it does not technically amplify sig-
                                                         nals as the output is not proportional to the input. The difference amplifier
                                                         of Fig. 6.10 also acts on the voltage difference between the inverting and
                                                         noninverting inputs, and as long as care is taken to avoid saturation, does
                                                         provide an output directly proportional to this difference. When dealing
                                                         with a very small input voltage, however, a better alternative is a device

known as an instrumentation amplifier, which is actually three op amp
devices in a single package.
    An example of the common instrumentation amplifier configuration is
shown in Fig. 6.38a, and its symbol is shown in Fig. 6.38b. Each input is fed
directly into a voltage follower stage, and the output of both voltage fol-
lowers is fed into a difference amplifier stage. It is particularly well suited
to applications where the input voltage signal is very small (for example, on
the order of millivolts), such as that produced by thermocouples or strain
gauges, and where a significant common-mode noise signal of several volts
may be present.

    If components of the instrumentation amplifier are fabricated all on the
same silicon “chip,” then it is possible to obtain well-matched device char-
acteristics and to achieve precise ratios for the two sets of resistors. In order
to maximize the CMRR of the instrumentation amplifier, we expect
R4 /R3 = R2 /R1 , so that equal amplification of common-mode components
of the input signals is obtained. To explore this further, we identify the volt-
age at the output of the top voltage follower as “v− ,” and the voltage at the
output of the bottom voltage follower as “v+ .” Assuming all three op amps
are ideal and naming the voltage at either input of the difference stage vx ,
we may write the following nodal equations:
                                       vx − v−   vx − vout
                                               +           =0                          [20]
                                          R1        R2
and
                                            vx − v+   vx
                                                    +    =0                            [21]
                                               R3     R4
Solving Eq. [21] for vx , we find that
                                                       v+
                                            vx =                                       [22]
                                                   1 + R3 /R4
and upon substituting into Eq. [20], obtain an expression for vout in terms of
the input:
                                          
                          R4 1 + R2 /R1             R2
                  vout =                      v+ −     v−                 [23]
                          R3 1 + R4 /R3             R1
   From Eq. [23] it is clear that the general case allows amplification of
common-mode components to the two inputs. In the specific case where
206   CHAPTER 6 THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER


      R4 /R3 = R2 /R1 = K, however, Eq. [23] reduces to K(v+ − v− ) = Kvd , so
      that (asssuming ideal op amps) only the difference is amplified and the gain
      is set by the resistor ratio. Since these resistors are internal to the instru-
      mentation amplifier and not accessible to the user, devices such as the
      AD622 allow the gain to be set anywhere in the range of 1 to 1000 by con-
      necting an external resistor between two pins (shown as RG in Fig. 6.38b).


      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      In this chapter we introduced a new circuit element—a three-terminal
      device—called the operational amplifier (or more commonly, the op amp).
      In many circuit analysis situations it is approximated as an ideal device,
      which leads to two rules that are applied. We studied several op amp circuits
      in detail, including the inverting amplifier with gain Rf R1, the noninverting
      amplifer with gain 1  Rf R1, and the summing amplifier. We were also
      introduced to the voltage follower and the difference amplifier, although the
      analysis of these two circuits was left for the reader. The concept of cas-
      caded stages was found to be particularly useful, as it allows a design to be
      broken down into distinct units, each of which has a specific function. We
      took a slight detour and introduced briefly a two-terminal nonlinear circuit
      element, the Zener diode, as it provides a practical and straightforward volt-
      age reference. We then used this element to contruct practical voltage and
      current sources using op amps, removing some of the mystery as to their
      origins.
          Modern op amps have nearly ideal characteristics, as we found when we
      opted for a more detailed model based on a dependent source. Still, nonide-
      alities are encountered occasionally, so we considered the role of negative
      feedback in reducing the effect of temperature and manufacturing-related
      variations in various parameters, common-mode rejection, and saturation.
      One of the most interesting nonideal characteristics of any op amp is slew
      rate. By simulating three different cases, we were able to see how the out-
      put voltage can struggle to follow the form of the input voltage signal once
      its frequency becomes high enough. We concluded the chapter with two
      special cases: the comparator, which intentionally makes use of our ability
      to saturate a practical (nonideal) op amp, and the instrumentation amplifier,
      which is routinely used to amplify very small voltages.
          This is a good point to pause, take a breath, and recap some of the key
      points. At the same time, we will highlight relevant examples as an aid to
      the reader.
      ❑   There are two fundamental rules that must be applied when analyzing
          ideal op amp circuits:
          1. No current ever flows into either input terminal. (Example 6.1)
          2. No voltage ever exists between the input terminals.
      ❑   Op amp circuits are usually analyzed for an output voltage in terms of
          some input quantity or quantities. (Examples 6.1, 6.2)
      ❑   Nodal analysis is typically the best choice in analyzing op amp
          circuits, and it is usually better to begin at the input, and work toward
          the output. (Examples 6.1, 6.2)
                                                                 READING FURTHER   207

❑   The output current of an op amp cannot be assumed; it must be
    found after the output voltage has been determined independently.
    (Example 6.2)
❑   The gain of an inverting op amp circuit is given by the equation
                                            Rf
                                 vout = −      vin
                                            R1
❑   The gain of a noninverting op amp circuit is given by the equation
                                           
                                         Rf
                             vout = 1 +        vin
                                         R1
    (Example 6.1)
❑   Cascaded stages may be analyzed one stage at a time to relate the
    output to the input. (Example 6.3)
❑   Zener diodes provide a convenient voltage reference. They are not
    symmetric, however, meaning the two terminals are not
    interchangeable. (Example 6.4)
❑   Op amps can be used to construct current sources which are
    independent of the load resistance over a specific current range.
    (Example 6.5)
❑   A resistor is almost always connected from the output pin of an op amp
    to its inverting input pin, which incorporates negative feedback into
    the circuit for increased stability.
❑   The ideal op amp model is based on the approximation of infinite
    open-loop gain A, infinite input resistance Ri, and zero output
    resistance Ro. (Example 6.6)
❑   In practice, the output voltage range of an op amp is limited by the
    supply voltages used to power the device. (Example 6.7)
❑   Comparators are op amps designed to be driven into saturation. These
    circuits operate in open loop, and hence have no external feedback
    resistor. (Example 6.8)

Chapter-Integrating Exercises
57. (a) You’re given an electronic switch which requires 5 V at 1 mA in order to
    close; it is open with no voltage present at its input. If the only microphone
    available produces a peak voltage of 250 mV, design a circuit which will ener-
    gize the switch when someone speaks into the microphone. Note that the audio
    level of a general voice may not correspond to the peak voltage of the micro-
    phone. (b) Discuss any issues that may need to be addressed if your circuit
    were to be implemented.
58. You’ve formed a band, despite advice to the contrary. Actually, the band is
    pretty good except for the fact that the lead singer (who owns the drum set, the
    microphones, and the garage where you practice) is a bit tone-deaf. Design a
    circuit that takes the output from each of the five microphones your band uses,
    and adds the voltages to create a single voltage signal which is fed to the am-
    plifer. Except not all voltages should be equally amplified. One microphone
    output should be attenuated such that its peak voltage is 10% of any other
    microphone’s peak voltage.
59. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is commonly used to fabricate resistors whose value
    depends on the intensity of light shining on the surface. In Fig. 6.61 a CdS
    “photocell” is used as the feedback resistor Rf. In total darkness, it has a
    resistance of 100 k, and a resistance of 10 k under a light intensity of
    6 candela. RL represents a circuit that is activated when a voltage of 1.5 V
    or less is applied to its terminals. Choose R1 and Vs so that the circuit
    represented by RL is activated by a light of 2 candela or brighter.

      60. A fountain outside a certain office building is designed to reach a maximum
          height of 5 meters at a flow rate of 100 l/s. A variable position valve in line
          with the water supply to the fountain can be controlled electrically, such that
          0 V applied results in the valve being fully open, and 5 V results in the valve
          being closed. In adverse wind conditions the maximum height of the fountain
          needs to be adjusted; if the wind velocity exceeds 50 km/h, the height cannot
          exceed 2 meters. A wind velocity sensor is available which provides a voltage
          calibrated such that 1 V corresponds to a wind velocity of 25 km/h. Design a
          circuit which uses the velocity sensor to control the fountain according to
          specifications.

   conventions for a capacitor.                       volt, or coulomb per volt. We will now define the farad1 (F) as one coulomb
                                                      per volt, and use this as our unit of capacitance.
                                                          The ideal capacitor defined by Eq. [1] is only a mathematical model of a
                                                      real device. A capacitor consists of two conducting surfaces on which
                                                      charge may be stored, separated by a thin insulating layer that has a very
                                                      large resistance. If we assume that this resistance is sufficiently large that it
                                                      may be considered infinite, then equal and opposite charges placed on the
                                                      capacitor “plates” can never recombine, at least by any path within the ele-
                                                      ment. The construction of the physical device is suggested by the circuit
                                                      symbol shown in Fig. 7.1.
                                                          Let us visualize some external device connected to this capacitor and
                                                      causing a positive current to flow into one plate of the capacitor and out of
                                                      the other plate. Equal currents are entering and leaving the two terminals,
                                                      and this is no more than we expect for any circuit element. Now let us ex-
                                                      amine the interior of the capacitor. The positive current entering one plate
                                                      represents positive charge moving toward that plate through its terminal
                                                      lead; this charge cannot pass through the interior of the capacitor, and it
                                                      therefore accumulates on the plate. As a matter of fact, the current and the
                                                      increasing charge are related by the familiar equation
                                                                                                    dq

                                                                                                    dt
                                                          Now let us consider this plate as an overgrown node and apply Kirchhoff’s
                                                      current law. It apparently does not hold; current is approaching the plate
                                                      from the external circuit, but it is not flowing out of the plate into the
                                                      “internal circuit.” This dilemma bothered a famous Scottish scientist, James
                                                      Clerk Maxwell, more than a century ago. The unified electromagnetic the-
                                                      ory that he subsequently developed hypothesizes a “displacement current”
                                                      that is present wherever an electric field or a voltage is varying with time.
                                                      The displacement current flowing internally between the capacitor plates is
                                                      exactly equal to the conduction current flowing in the capacitor leads;
                                                      Kirchhoff’s current law is therefore satisfied if we include both conduction
                                                      and displacement currents. However, circuit analysis is not concerned with
                                                      this internal displacement current, and since it is fortunately equal to the
                                                      conduction current, we may consider Maxwell’s hypothesis as relating the
                                                      conduction current to the changing voltage across the capacitor.

the linear dimensions of the conducting plates are all very much greater
than d. For air or vacuum, ε = ε0 = 8.854 pF/m. Most capacitors employ a
thin dielectric layer with a larger permittivity than air in order to minimize the
device size. Examples of various types of commercially available capacitors
are shown in Fig. 7.2, although we should remember that any two conducting
surfaces not in direct contact with each other may be characterized by a
nonzero (although probably small) capacitance. We should also note that a
capacitance of several hundred microfarads (μF) is considered “large.”
    Several important characteristics of our new mathematical model can be
discovered from the defining equation, Eq. [1]. A constant voltage across a
capacitor results in zero current passing through it; a capacitor is thus an
“open circuit to dc.” This fact is pictorially represented by the capacitor
symbol. It is also apparent that a sudden jump in the voltage requires an in-
finite current. Since this is physically impossible, we will therefore prohibit
the voltage across a capacitor to change in zero time.

        The current i is related to the voltage v across the capacitor by Eq. [1]:

           For the voltage waveform depicted in Fig. 7.3a, dv/dt = 0, so
        i = 0; the result is plotted in Fig. 7.4a. For the case of the sinusoidal
        waveform of Fig. 7.3b, we expect a cosine current waveform to flow in
        response, having the same frequency and twice the magnitude (since
        C  2 F). The result is plotted in Fig. 7.4b.

      Integral Voltage-Current Relationships
      The capacitor voltage may be expressed in terms of the current by integrat-
      ing Eq. [1]. We first obtain
                                                              1
                                                  dv =          i(t) dt
                                                              C
      and then integrate2 between the times t0 and t and between the correspond-
      ing voltages v(t0 ) and v(t):
                                                       t
                                                  1
                                      v(t) =                  i(t  ) dt  + v(t0 )                           [2]
                                                  C     t0


          Equation [2] may also be written as an indefinite integral plus a constant
      of integration:
                                           
                                         1
                                 v(t) =        i dt + k
                                         C

      (2) Note that we are employing the mathematically correct procedure of defining a dummy variable t  in
      situations where the integration variable t is also a limit.

   Finally, in many situations we will find that v(t0 ), the voltage initially
across the capacitor, is not able to be discerned. In such instances it is
mathematically convenient to set t0 = −∞ and v(−∞) = 0, so that
                                     
                                   1 t
                           v(t) =         i dt 
                                   C −∞
   Since the integral of the current over any time interval is the correspond-
ing charge accumulated on the capacitor plate into which the current is
flowing, we may also define capacitance as
                                        q(t) = Cv(t)
where q(t) and v(t) represent instantaneous values of the charge on either
plate and the voltage between the plates, respectively.

 Equation [2] is the appropriate expression here:

                              1 t 
                       v(t) =       i(t ) dt  + v(t0 )
                              C t0
 but now it needs to be interpreted graphically. To do this, we note that
 the difference in voltage between times t and t0 is proportional to the
 area under the current curve defined by the same two times. The con-
 stant of proportionality is 1/C.
    From Fig. 7.5a, we see three separate intervals: t ≤ 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 ms,
 and t ≥ 2 ms. Defining the first interval more specifically as between
 −∞ and 0, so that t0 = −∞, we note two things, both a consequence
 of the fact that the current has always been zero up to t = 0: First,
                                   v(t0 ) = v(−∞) = 0
    Second, the integral of the current between t0 = −∞ and 0 is simply
 zero, since i = 0 in that interval. Thus,
                        v(t) = 0 + v(−∞)                −∞ ≤ t ≤ 0
 or
                                    v(t) = 0          t ≤0
                                                                      (Continued on next page)

                                                 If we now consider the time interval represented by the rectangular
                                              pulse, we obtain
                                                                               t

                                                 Since v(0) = 0,
                                                                    v(t) = 4000t        0 ≤ t ≤ 2 ms

                                                  For the semi-infinite interval following the pulse, the integral of i(t)
                                              is once again zero, so that

                                             Energy Storage
                                             To determine the energy stored in a capacitor, we begin with the power
                                             delivered to it:
                                                                                           dv
                                                                            p = vi = Cv
                                                                                           dt
                                             The change in energy stored in its electric field is simply

                                                Let us consider a simple numerical example. As sketched in Fig. 7.7, a

 Devise a plan.
  Determine the energy in the capacitor by evaluating the voltage. To
  find the energy dissipated in the resistor during the same time interval,
  integrate the dissipated power, p R = i R2 · R.

 Construct an appropriate set of equations.
  The energy stored in the capacitor is simply
                   wC (t) = 12 Cv 2 = 0.1 sin2 2πt          J

     We obtain an expression for the power dissipated by the resistor in
  terms of the current iR:

  and so                                                                             wC (t) = 0.1 sin2 2␲t (J)

 Attempt a solution.
  From our sketch of the expression for the energy stored in the capaci-
  tor, we see that it increases from zero at t = 0 to a maximum of
  100 mJ at t = 14 s, and then decreases to zero in another 14 s. Thus,
  wCmax = 100 mJ. Evaluating our integral expression for the energy
  dissipated in the resistor, we find that w R = 2.5 mJ.

224   CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS



       Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
         We do not expect to calculate a negative stored energy, which is borne out
         in our sketch. Further, since the maximum value of sin 2πt is 1, the maxi-
         mum energy expected anywhere would be (1/2)(20 × 10−6 )(100)2 =
         100 mJ.
             The resistor dissipated 2.5 mJ in the period of 0 to 500 ms,
         although the capacitor stored a maximum of 100 mJ at one point
         during that interval. What happened to the “other” 97.5 mJ? To
         answer this, we compute the capacitor current
                                                         dv
                                       i C = 20 × 10−6      = 0.004π cos 2πt
                                                         dt
         and the current is defined as flowing into the voltage source
                                                  i s = −i C − i R
         both of which are plotted in Fig. 7.9. We observe that the current flow-
         ing through the resistor is a small fraction of the source current, not
         entirely surprising as 1 M is a relatively large resistance value. As
         current flows from the source, a small amount is diverted to the
         resistor, with the rest flowing into the capacitor as it charges. After
         t = 250 ms, the source current is seen to change sign; current is now
         flowing from the capacitor back into the source. Most of the energy
         stored in the capacitor is being returned to the ideal voltage source,
         except for the small fraction dissipated in the resistor.

  Important Characteristics of an Ideal Capacitor
  1. There is no current through a capacitor if the voltage across it is not
     changing with time. A capacitor is therefore an open circuit to dc.
  2. A finite amount of energy can be stored in a capacitor even if the
     current through the capacitor is zero, such as when the voltage
     across it is constant.
  3. It is impossible to change the voltage across a capacitor by a finite
     amount in zero time, as this requires an infinite current through the
     capacitor. (A capacitor resists an abrupt change in the voltage
     across it in a manner analogous to the way a spring resists an
     abrupt change in its displacement.)
  4. A capacitor never dissipates energy, but only stores it. Although
     this is true for the mathematical model, it is not true for a physical
     capacitor due to finite resistances associated with the dielectric as
     well as the packaging.




7.2 THE INDUCTOR
     •
Ideal Inductor Model
In the early 1800s the Danish scientist Oersted showed that a current-
carrying conductor produced a magnetic field (compass needles were
affected in the presence of a wire when current was flowing). Shortly there-
after, Ampère made some careful measurements which demonstrated that
this magnetic field was linearly related to the current which produced it.
The next step occurred some 20 years later when the English experimental-
ist Michael Faraday and the American inventor Joseph Henry discovered
almost simultaneously3 that a changing magnetic field could induce a volt-
age in a neighboring circuit. They showed that this voltage was proportional
to the time rate of change of the current producing the magnetic field. The
constant of proportionality is what we now call the inductance, symbolized
by L, and therefore

where we must realize that v and i are both functions of time. When we wish
to emphasize this, we may do so by using the symbols v(t) and i(t).
    The circuit symbol for the inductor is shown in Fig. 7.10, and it should                     iL

                                                      model; it is an ideal element which we may use to approximate the behavior
                                                      of a real device. A physical inductor may be constructed by winding a
                                                      length of wire into a coil. This serves effectively to increase the current that
                                                      is causing the magnetic field and also to increase the “number” of neigh-
                                                      boring circuits into which Faraday’s voltage may be induced. The result of
                                                      this twofold effect is that the inductance of a coil is approximately propor-
                                                      tional to the square of the number of complete turns made by the conduc-
                                                      tor out of which it is formed. For example, an inductor or “coil” that has the
                                                      form of a long helix of very small pitch is found to have an inductance of
                                                      μN 2 A/s, where A is the cross-sectional area, s is the axial length of the he-
                                                      lix, N is the number of complete turns of wire, and μ (mu) is a constant of
                                                      the material inside the helix, called the permeability. For free space (and
                                                      very closely for air), μ = μ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m = 4π nH/cm. Several ex-
                                                      amples of commercially available inductors are shown in Fig. 7.11.
                                                          Let us now scrutinize Eq. [5] to determine some of the electrical charac-
                                                      teristics of the mathematical model. This equation shows that the voltage
                                                      across an inductor is proportional to the time rate of change of the current
                                                      through it. In particular, it shows that there is no voltage across an inductor
                                                      carrying a constant current, regardless of the magnitude of this current.
                                                      Accordingly, we may view an inductor as a short circuit to dc.
                                                          Another fact that can be obtained from Eq. [5] is that a sudden or dis-
                                                      continuous change in the current must be associated with an infinite voltage
                                                      across the inductor. In other words, if we wish to produce an abrupt change
                                                      in an inductor current, we must apply an infinite voltage. Although an
                                                      infinite-voltage forcing function might be amusing theoretically, it can
                                                      never be a part of the phenomena displayed by a real physical device. As we

shall see shortly, an abrupt change in the inductor current also requires an
abrupt change in the energy stored in the inductor, and this sudden change
in energy requires infinite power at that instant; infinite power is again not a
part of the real physical world. In order to avoid infinite voltage and infinite
power, an inductor current must not be allowed to jump instantaneously
from one value to another.
    If an attempt is made to open-circuit a physical inductor through which
a finite current is flowing, an arc may appear across the switch. This is use-
ful in the ignition system of some automobiles, where the current through
the spark coil is interrupted by the distributor and the arc appears across the
spark plug. Although this does not occur instantaneously, it happens in a
very short timespan, leading to the creation of a large voltage. The pres-
ence of a large voltage across a short distance equates to a very large
electric field; the stored energy is dissipated in ionizing the air in the path
of the arc.
    Equation [5] may also be interpreted (and solved, if necessary) by
graphical methods, as seen in Example 7.4.

 ■ FIGURE 7.12 (a) The current waveform in a 3 H inductor. (b) The corresponding voltage
   waveform, v = 3 di/dt.

 Defining the voltage v and the current i to satisfy the passive sign con-
 vention, we may obtain v from Fig. 7.12a using Eq. [5]:
                                                  di

                                                  dt

    Since the current is zero for t < −1 s, the voltage is zero in this inter-
 val. The current then begins to increase at the linear rate of 1 A/s, and
 thus a constant voltage of L di/dt = 3 V is produced. During the
 following 2 s interval, the current is constant and the voltage is there-
 fore zero. The final decrease of the current results in di/dt = −1 A/s,
 yielding v = −3 V. For t > 3 s, i(t) is a constant (zero), so that
 v(t) = 0 for that interval. The complete voltage waveform is sketched
 in Fig. 7.12b.

                   Let us now investigate the effect of a more rapid rise and decay of the
                current between the 0 and l A values.

                 Note that the intervals for the rise and fall have decreased to 0.1 s.
                 Thus, the magnitude of each derivative will be 10 times larger; this
                 condition is shown in the current and voltage sketches of Fig. 7.14a
                 and b. In the voltage waveforms of Fig. 7.13b and 7.14b, it is interest-
                 ing to note that the area under each voltage pulse is 3 V · s.


                    Just for curiosity’s sake, let’s continue in the same vein for a moment. A
                further decrease in the rise and fall times of the current waveform will pro-
                duce a proportionally larger voltage magnitude, but only within the interval

current will cause the infinite voltage “spikes” (each having an area of
3 V · s) that are suggested by the waveforms of Fig. 7.15a and b; or, from                          1
the equally valid but opposite point of view, these infinite voltage spikes are
required to produce the abrupt changes in the current.                                                                                      t (s)

may consider an inductor to be a short circuit to direct current, and we have
agreed that we cannot permit an inductor current to change abruptly from
one value to another, because this would require that an infinite voltage and
power be associated with the inductor. The simple defining equation for
inductance contains still more information, however. Rewritten in a slightly
different form,

it invites integration. Let us first consider the limits to be placed on the two
integrals. We desire the current i at time t, and this pair of quantities there-
fore provides the upper limits on the integrals appearing on the left and right
sides of the equation, respectively; the lower limits may also be kept general
by merely assuming that the current is i(t0 ) at time t0 . Thus,

                     We also may assume that we are solving a realistic problem in which the
                selection of t0 as −∞ ensures no current or energy in the inductor. Thus, if
                i(t0 ) = i(−∞) = 0, then

                   Let us investigate the use of these several integrals by working a simple
                example where the voltage across an inductor is specified.


  EXAMPLE 7.6
                 The voltage across a 2 H inductor is known to be 6 cos 5t V.
                 Determine the resulting inductor current if i(t  −π/2)  1 A.
                 From Eq. [6],
                                                     t

                                i(t) =          sin 5t −         sin 5t0 + i(t0 )

                                     = 0.6 sin 5t − 0.6 sin 5t0 + i(t0 )
                    The first term indicates that the inductor current varies sinusoidally;
                 the second and third terms together represent a constant which becomes
                 known when the current is numerically specified at some instant of
                 time. Using the fact that the current is 1 A at t = −π/2 s, we identify t0
                 as −π/2 with i(t0 ) = 1, and find that
                                   i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t − 0.6 sin(−2.5π) + 1
                 or
                                            i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t + 1.6
                      Alternatively, from Eq. [6],
                                             i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t + k
                 and we establish the numerical value of k by forcing the current to be
                 1 A at t = −π/2:
                                           1 = 0.6 sin(−2.5π) + k
                 or
                                                k = 1 + 0.6 = 1.6
                 and so, as before,
                                            i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t + 1.6

    Equation [8] is going to cause trouble with this particular voltage.
 We based the equation on the assumption that the current was zero
 when t = −∞. To be sure, this must be true in the real, physical world,
 but we are working in the land of the mathematical model; our ele-
 ments and forcing functions are all idealized. The difficulty arises after
 we integrate, obtaining
                                               t
                           i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t  −∞
 and attempt to evaluate the integral at the lower limit:
                          i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t − 0.6 sin(−∞)
    The sine of ±∞ is indeterminate, and therefore we cannot evaluate
 our expression. Equation [8] is only useful if we are evaluating func-
 tions which approach zero as t → −∞.

    We should not make any snap judgments, however, as to which single
form of Eqs. [6], [7], and [8] we are going to use forever after; each has its
advantages, depending on the problem and the application. Equation [6]
represents a long, general method, but it shows clearly that the constant of
integration is a current. Equation [7] is a somewhat more concise expression
of Eq. [6], but the nature of the integration constant is suppressed. Finally,
Eq. [8] is an excellent expression, since no constant is necessary; however,
it applies only when the current is zero at t = −∞ and when the analytical
expression for the current is not indeterminate there.

Energy Storage
Let us now turn our attention to power and energy. The absorbed power is
given by the current-voltage product
                                                  di
                                  p = vi = Li
                                                  dt
   The energy w L accepted by the inductor is stored in the magnetic field
around the coil. The change in this energy is expressed by the integral of the
power over the desired time interval:
                     t              t           i(t)
                                   di 
                        p dt = L   i  dt = L             i  di 
                     t0          t0 dt             i(t0 )

                             = L [i(t)]2 − [i(t0 )]2
                               2
Thus,
                                                                  
                    w L (t) − w L (t0 ) = 12 L [i(t)]2 − [i(t0 )]2                [9]

                                                         where we have again assumed that the current is i(t0 ) at time t0 . In using the
                                                         energy expression, it is customary to assume that a value of t0 is selected at
                                                         which the current is zero; it is also customary to assume that the energy is
                                                         zero at this time. We then have simply


                                                                                         w L (t) = 12 Li 2                           [10]


                                                         where we now understand that our reference for zero energy is any time at
                                                         which the inductor current is zero. At any subsequent time at which the cur-
                                                         rent is zero, we also find no energy stored in the coil. Whenever the current
                                                         is not zero, and regardless of its direction or sign, energy is stored in the in-
                                                         ductor. It follows, therefore, that energy may be delivered to the inductor for
                                                         a part of the time and recovered from the inductor later. All the stored
                                                         energy may be recovered from an ideal inductor; there are no storage
                                                         charges or agent’s commissions in the mathematical model. A physical coil,
                                                         however, must be constructed out of real wire and thus will always have a
                                                         resistance associated with it. Energy can no longer be stored and recovered
                                                         without loss.
                                                             These ideas may be illustrated by a simple example. In Fig. 7.16, a 3 H
                                                         inductor is shown in series with a 0.1  resistor and a sinusoidal current

                                                         of the wire which must be associated with the physical coil.

                                                              After reaching its peak value at t = 3 s, the energy has completely

 covering 216 J in a 6 s interval. This represents 20 percent of the maxi-
 mum stored energy, but it is a reasonable value for many coils having
 this large an inductance. For coils having an inductance of about
 100 μH, we might expect a figure closer to 2 or 3 percent.

   We summarize by listing four key characteristics of an inductor which
result from its defining equation v = L di/dt :


  Important Characteristics of an Ideal Inductor
  1. There is no voltage across an inductor if the current through it is
     not changing with time. An inductor is therefore a short circuit
     to dc.
  2. A finite amount of energy can be stored in an inductor even if
     the voltage across the inductor is zero, such as when the current
     through it is constant.
  3. It is impossible to change the current through an inductor by a
     finite amount in zero time, for this requires an infinite voltage
     across the inductor. (An inductor resists an abrupt change in the
     current through it in a manner analogous to the way a mass resists

  4. The inductor never dissipates energy, but only stores it. Although
     this is true for the mathematical model, it is not true for a physical
     inductor due to series resistances.


    It is interesting to anticipate our discussion of duality in Sec. 7.6 by
rereading the previous four statements with certain words replaced by their
“duals.” If capacitor and inductor, capacitance and inductance, voltage and
current, across and through, open circuit and short circuit, spring and mass,
and displacement and velocity are interchanged (in either direction), the
four statements previously given for capacitors are obtained.

7.3 INDUCTANCE AND CAPACITANCE
   • COMBINATIONS
Now that we have added the inductor and capacitor to our list of passive cir-
cuit elements, we need to decide whether or not the methods we have de-
veloped for resistive circuit analysis are still valid. It will also be convenient
to learn how to replace series and parallel combinations of either of these
elements with simpler equivalents, just as we did with resistors in Chap. 3.
    We look first at Kirchhoff’s two laws, both of which are axiomatic.
However, when we hypothesized these two laws, we did so with no restric-
tions as to the types of elements constituting the network. Both, therefore,
remain valid.

Inductors in Series
Now we may extend the procedures we have derived for reducing various
combinations of resistors into one equivalent resistor to the analogous cases
of inductors and capacitors. We shall first consider an ideal voltage source
applied to the series combination of N inductors, as shown in Fig. 7.18a.
We desire a single equivalent inductor, with inductance L eq , which may re-
place the series combination so that the source current i(t) is unchanged.
The equivalent circuit is sketched in Fig. 7.18b. Applying KVL to the orig-
inal circuit,
                          vs = v1 + v2 + · · · + v N

                                                             di
                               = (L 1 + L 2 + · · · + L N )
                                                             dt
or, written more concisely,
                                  N             N
                                                          di   di N

But for the equivalent circuit we have
                                                          di
                                             vs = L eq
                                                          dt
and thus the equivalent inductance is

                                                        as vs . Since both sources are specified for all time, we should be able to

    We will not attempt the solution of integrodifferential equations here. It is    ■ FIGURE 7.26
worthwhile pointing out, however, that when the voltage forcing functions are
sinusoidal functions of time, it will be possible to define a voltage-current
ratio (called impedance) or a current-voltage ratio (called admittance) for
each of the three passive elements. The factors operating on the two node
voltages in the preceding equations will then become simple multiplying fac-
tors, and the equations will be linear algebraic equations once again. These we
may solve by determinants or a simple elimination of variables as before.
    We may also show that the benefits of linearity apply to RLC circuits as
well. In accordance with our previous definition of a linear circuit, these
circuits are also linear because the voltage-current relationships for the
inductor and capacitor are linear relationships. For the inductor, we have
                                            di
                                    v=L
                                            dt
and multiplication of the current by some constant K leads to a voltage that
is also greater by a factor K. In the integral formulation,
                                      
                                   1 t
                          i(t) =          v dt  + i(t0 )
                                   L t0
it can be seen that, if each term is to increase by a factor of K, then the ini-
tial value of the current must also increase by this same factor.
    A corresponding investigation of the capacitor shows that it, too, is lin-
ear. Thus, a circuit composed of independent sources, linear dependent
sources, and linear resistors, inductors, and capacitors is a linear circuit.
    In this linear circuit the response is again proportional to the forcing
function. The proof of this statement is accomplished by first writing a
general system of integrodifferential equations. Let us place all the terms
having the form of Ri, L di/dt, and 1/C i dt on the left side of each
equation, and keep the independent source voltages on the right side. As a
simple example, one of the equations might have the form
                                     
                            di    1 t
                   Ri + L       +        i dt  + vC (t0 ) = vs
                            dt    C t0
    If every independent source is now increased by a factor K, then the
right side of each equation is greater by the factor K. Now each term on the
left side is either a linear term involving some loop current or an initial
capacitor voltage. In order to cause all the responses (loop currents) to in-
crease by a factor K, it is apparent that we must also increase the initial
capacitor voltages by a factor K. That is, we must treat the initial capacitor
voltage as an independent source voltage and increase it also by a factor K.
In a similar manner, initial inductor currents appear as independent source
currents in nodal analysis.
    The principle of proportionality between source and response can thus
be extended to the general RLC circuit, and it follows that the principle of
superposition also applies. It should be emphasized that initial inductor

                                                currents and capacitor voltages must be treated as independent sources in
                                                applying the superposition principle; each initial value must take its turn
                                                in being rendered inactive. In Chap. 5 we learned that the principle of
                                                superposition is a natural consequence of the linear nature of resistive
                                                circuits. The resistive circuits are linear because the voltage-current rela-
                                                tionship for the resistor is linear and Kirchhoff’s laws are linear.
                                                     Before we can apply the superposition principle to RLC circuits, how-
                                                ever, it is first necessary to develop methods of solving the equations
                                                describing these circuits when only one independent source is present. At
                                                this time we should feel convinced that a linear circuit will possess a re-
                                                sponse whose amplitude is proportional to the amplitude of the source. We
                                                should be prepared to apply superposition later, considering an inductor
                                                current or capacitor voltage specified at t = t0 as a source that must be
                                                deactivated when its turn comes.
                                                     Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are based on the linearity of the ini-

                                                ciple. The general RLC circuit conforms perfectly to these requirements,
                                                and it follows, therefore, that all linear circuits that contain any combina-

                                                    •
                                                In Chap. 6 we were introduced to several different types of amplifier circuits
                                                based on the ideal op amp. In almost every case, we found that the output was
                                                related to the input voltage by some combination of resistance ratios. If we
                                                replace one or more of these resistors with a capacitor, it is possible to obtain
                                                some interesting circuits in which the output is proportional to either the
                                                derivative or integral of the input voltage. Such circuits find widespread use
                                                in practice. For example, a velocity sensor can be connected to an op amp cir-
                                                cuit that provides a signal proportional to the acceleration, or an output signal
                                                can be obtained that represents the total charge incident on a metal electrode
                                                during a specific period of time by simply integrating the measured current.
                                                    To create an integrator using an ideal op amp, we ground the noninvert-

    We therefore have combined a resistor, a capacitor, and an op amp to form
an integrator. Note that the first term of the output is 1/RC times the negative
of the integral of the input from t  = 0 to t, and the second term is the nega-
tive of the initial value of vC f . The value of (RC)−1 can be made equal to
unity, if we wish, by choosing R = 1 M and C = 1 μF, for example; other
selections may be made that will increase or decrease the output voltage.
    Before we leave the integrator circuit, we might anticipate a question
from an inquisitive reader, “Could we use an inductor in place of the capaci-
tor and obtain a differentiator?” Indeed we could, but circuit designers usu-
ally avoid the use of inductors whenever possible because of their size,
weight, cost, and associated resistance and capacitance. Instead, it is possi-
ble to interchange the positions of the resistor and capacitor in Fig. 7.27 and
obtain a differentiator.

                                                                     Let us first draw a line to represent the reference node, and then we may

                                                                     Dual circuits may be obtained more readily than by this method, for the
                                                                 equations need not be written. In order to construct the dual of a given cir-
                                                                 cuit, we think of the circuit in terms of its mesh equations. With each mesh
                                                                 we must associate a nonreference node, and, in addition, we must supply the
                                                                 reference node. On a diagram of the given circuit we therefore place a
                                                                                   SECTION 7.6 DUALITY   243

node in the center of each mesh and supply the reference node as a line near
the diagram or a loop enclosing the diagram. Each element that appears
jointly in two meshes is a mutual element and gives rise to identical terms,
except for sign, in the two corresponding mesh equations. It must be re-
placed by an element that supplies the dual term in the two corresponding
nodal equations. This dual element must therefore be connected directly be-
tween the two nonreference nodes that are within the meshes in which the
given mutual element appears.
    The nature of the dual element itself is easily determined; the mathe-
matical form of the equations will be the same only if inductance is replaced
by capacitance, capacitance by inductance, conductance by resistance, and
resistance by conductance. Thus, the 4 H inductor which is common to
meshes 1 and 2 in the circuit of Fig. 7.30 appears as a 4 F capacitor con-
nected directly between nodes 1 and 2 in the dual circuit.
    Elements that appear only in one mesh must have duals that appear be-
tween the corresponding node and the reference node. Referring again to
Fig. 7.30, the voltage source 2 cos 6t V appears only in mesh 1; its dual is a
current source 2 cos 6t A, which is connected only to node 1 and the refer-
ence node. Since the voltage source is clockwise-sensed, the current source
must be into-the-nonreference-node-sensed. Finally, provision must be
made for the dual of the initial voltage present across the 8 F capacitor in the
given circuit. The equations have shown us that the dual of this initial volt-
age across the capacitor is an initial current through the inductor in the dual
circuit; the numerical values are the same, and the correct sign of the initial
current may be determined most readily by considering both the initial volt-
age in the given circuit and the initial current in the dual circuit as sources.
Thus, if vC in the given circuit is treated as a source, it would appear as −vC
on the right side of the mesh equation; in the dual circuit, treating the cur-
rent iL as a source would yield a term −iL on the right side of the nodal equa-
tion. Since each has the same sign when treated as a source, then, if
vC (0) = 10 V, i L (0) must be 10 A.
    The circuit of Fig. 7.30 is repeated in Fig. 7.32, and its exact dual is con-
structed on the circuit diagram itself by merely drawing the dual of each
given element between the two nodes that are inside the two meshes that are
common to the given element. A reference node that surrounds the given
circuit may be helpful. After the dual circuit is redrawn in more standard
form, it appears as shown in Fig. 7.31.

            (b) The dual circuit is drawn in more conventional form for comparison to the original.


              An additional example of the construction of a dual circuit is shown in
          Fig. 7.33a and b. Since no particular element values are specified, these two
          circuits are duals, but not necessarily exact duals. The original circuit may
          be recovered from the dual by placing a node in the center of each of the five
          meshes of Fig. 7.33b and proceeding as before.
              The concept of duality may also be carried over into the language by which
          we describe circuit analysis or operation. For example, if we are given a volt-
          age source in series with a capacitor, we might wish to make the important
          statement, “The voltage source causes a current to flow through the capacitor.”
          The dual statement is, “The current source causes a voltage to exist across the
          inductor.” The dual of a less carefully worded statement, such as “The current
          goes round and round the series circuit,” may require a little inventiveness.4
              Practice in using dual language can be obtained by reading Thévenin’s
          theorem in this sense; Norton’s theorem should result.
              We have spoken of dual elements, dual language, and dual circuits.
          What about a dual network? Consider a resistor R and an inductor L in
          series. The dual of this two-terminal network exists and is most readily
          obtained by connecting some ideal source to the given network. The dual
          circuit is then obtained as the dual source in parallel with a conductance G
          with the same magnitude as R, and a capacitance C having the same magni-
          tude as L. We consider the dual network as the two-terminal network that is
          connected to the dual source; it is thus a pair of terminals between which G
          and C are connected in parallel.
              Before leaving the definition of duality, we should point out that duality
          is defined on the basis of mesh and nodal equations. Since nonplanar
          circuits cannot be described by a system of mesh equations, a circuit that
          cannot be drawn in planar form does not possess a dual.
              We shall use duality principally to reduce the work that we must do to
          analyze the simple standard circuits. After we have analyzed the series RL
          circuit, the parallel RC circuit requires less attention, not because it is less
          important, but because the analysis of the dual network is already known.
          Since the analysis of some complicated circuit is not apt to be well known,
          duality will usually not provide us with any quick solution.

          (4) Someone suggested, “The voltage is across all over the parallel circuit.”

7.7 MODELING CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
   • WITH PSPICE
When using PSpice to analyze circuits containing inductors and capacitors, it
is frequently necessary to be able to specify the initial condition of each
element [i.e., vC (0) and i L (0)]. This is achieved by double-clicking on the
element symbol, resulting in the dialog box shown in Fig. 7.35a. At the far
right (not shown), we find the value of the capacitance, which defaults to 1 nF.
We can also specify the initial condition (IC), set to 2 V in Fig. 7.35a. Click-
ing on the right mouse button and selecting Display results in the dialog box
shown in Fig. 7.35b, which allows the initial condition to be displayed on the
schematic. The procedure for setting the initial condition of an inductor is es-
sentially the same. We should also note that when a capacitor is first placed in
the schematic, it appears horizontally; the positive reference terminal for the
initial voltage is the left terminal.

                                                 form what is referred to as a transient analysis. Under the PSpice menu,
                                                 we create a New Simulation Profile named op amp integrator, which

 time at which the simulation is terminated; PSpice will select its own
 discrete times at which to calculate the various voltages and currents.
 Occasionally we obtain an error message stating that the transient solu-
 tion could not converge, or the output waveform does not appear as
 smooth as we would like. In such situations, it is useful to set a value for
 Maximum step size, which has been set to 0.5 ms in this example.
    From our earlier analysis and Eq. [17], we expect the output to be
 proportional to the negative integral of the input waveform, i.e.,
 vout = 0.319 cos 100t − 2.319 V, as shown in Fig. 7.39. The initial
 condition of 2 V across the capacitor has combined with a constant
 term from the integration to result in a nonzero average value for the
 output, unlike the input which has an average value of zero.

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
A large number of practical circuits can be effectively modeled using only
resistors and voltage/current sources. However, most interesting everyday
occurrences somehow involve something changing with time, and in such
cases intrinsic capacitances and/or inductances can become important. We
employ such energy storage elements consciously as well, for example, in the
design of frequency-selective filters, capacitor banks, and electric vehicle mo-
tors. An ideal capacitor is modeled as having infinite shunt resistance, and a
current which depends on the time rate of change of the terminal voltage.
Capacitance is measured in units of farads (F). Conversely, an ideal inductor
is modeled as having zero series resistance, and a terminal voltage which de-
pends on the time rate of change of the current. Inductance is measured in
248   CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS


      units of henrys (H). Either element can store energy; the amount of energy
      present in a capacitor (stored in its electric field) is proportional to the square
      of the terminal voltage, and the amount of energy present in an inductor
      (stored in its magnetic field) is proportional to the square of its current.
           As we found for resistors, we can simplify some connections of capaci-
      tors (or inductors) using series/parallel combinations. The validity of such
      equivalents arises from KCL and KVL. Once we have simplified a circuit as
      much as possible (taking care not to “combine away” a component which is
      used to define a current or voltage of interest to us), nodal and mesh analy-
      sis can be applied to circuits with capacitors and inductors. However, the
      resulting integrodifferential equations are often nontrivial to solve, and so
      we will consider some practical approaches in the next two chapters. Simple
      circuits, however, such as those which involve a single operational ampli-
      fier, can be analyzed easily. We found (to our surprise) that such circuits can
      be used as signal integrators or differentiators. Consequently, they provide
      an output signal that tells us how some input quantity (accumulating charge
      during ion implantation into a silicon wafer, for example) varies with time.
           As a final note, capacitors and inductors provide a particularly strong
      example of the concept known as duality. KCL and KVL, mesh and nodal
      analysis are other examples. Circuits are rarely analyzed using this idea, but
      it is nevertheless important, since the implication is that we only need to
      learn roughly “half” of the complete set of concepts, and then determine
      how to translate the remainder. Some people find this helpful; others don’t.
      Regardless, capacitors and inductors are straightforward to model in PSpice
      and other circuit simulation tools, allowing us to check our answers. The
      difference between those elements and resistors in such software packages
      is that we must take care to set the initial condition properly.
           As an additional review aid, here we list some key points from the
      chapter, and identify relevant example(s).
      ❑ The current through a capacitor is given by i = C dv/dt . (Example 7.1)
      ❑ The voltage across a capacitor is related to its current by

       4. A capacitor is constructed from two copper plates, each measuring 1 mm ×
          2.5 mm and 155 μm thick. The two plates are placed such that they face each
          other and are separated by a 1 μm gap. Calculate the resulting capacitance if
          (a) the intervening dielectric has a permittivity of 1.35ε0 ; (b) the intervening
          dielectric has a permittivity of 3.5ε0 ; (c) the plate separation is increased by
          3.5 μm and the gap is filled with air; (d) the plate area is doubled and the
          1 μm gap is filled with air.
       5. Two pieces of gadolinium, each measuring 100 μm × 750 μm and 604 nm
          thick, are used to construct a capacitor. The two plates are arranged such that
          they face each other and are separated by a 100 nm gap. Calculate the resulting
          capacitance if (a) the intervening dielectric has a permittivity of 13.8ε0 ; (b) the
          intervening dielectric has a permittivity of 500ε0 ; (c) the plate separation is
          increased by 100 nm and the gap is filled with air; (d) the plate area is quadru-
          pled and the 100 nm gap is filled with air.
       6. Design a 100 nF capacitor constructed from 1 μm thick gold foil, and which
          fits entirely within a volume equal to that of a standard AAA battery, if the only
          dielectric available has a permittivity of 3.1ε0 .
       7. Design a capacitor whose capacitance can be varied mechanically with a
          simple vertical motion, between the values of 100 nF and 300 nF.
       8. Design a capacitor whose capacitance can be varied mechanically over the
          range of 50 nF and 100 nF by rotating a knob 90◦ .
       9. A silicon pn junction diode is characterized by a junction capacitance defined as
                                                    K s ε0 A
                                             Cj =
                                                      W
         where K s = 11.8 for silicon, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, A = the cross-
         sectional area of the junction, and W is known as the depletion width of the
         junction. Width W depends not only on how the diode is fabricated, but also on
         the voltage applied to its two terminals. It can be computed using
                                           
                                             2K s ε0

                                              qN
          Thus, diodes are frequently used in electronic circuits, since they can be
          thought of as voltage-controlled capacitors. Assuming parameter values of
          N = 1018 cm−3 , Vbi = 0.57 V, and using q = 1.6 × 10−19 C, calculate the
          capacitance of a diode with cross-sectional area A  1 μm × 1 μm at applied
          voltages of V A = −1, −5, and −10 volts.
      10. Assuming the passive sign convention, sketch the voltage which develops
          across the terminals of a 2.5 F capacitor in response to the current waveforms

                                                    (a) Design a circuit to provide a voltage proportional to the linear acceleration

                                                    this application require?
                                                59. A floating sensor in a certain fuel tank is connected to a variable resistor (often
                                                    called a potentiometer) such that a full tank (100 liters) corresponds to 1  and
                                                    an empty tank corresponds to 10 . (a) Design a circuit that provides an output
                                                    voltage which indicates the amount of fuel remaining, so that 1 V = empty and
                                                    5 V = full. (b) Design a circuit to indicate the rate of fuel consumption by
                                                    providing a voltage output calibrated to yield 1 V = 1 l/s.

          containing both inductance and capacitance, but we did not solve
          any of them. Now we are ready to proceed with the solution of the         Calculating the Time-
          simpler circuits, namely, those which contain only resistors and          Dependent Response to DC
          inductors, or only resistors and capacitors.                              Excitation

          The analysis of circuits containing inductors and/or capacitors is de-
          pendent upon the formulation and solution of the integrodifferential
          equations that characterize the circuits. We will call the special type
          of equation we obtain a homogeneous linear differential equation,
          which is simply a differential equation in which every term is of the
          first degree in the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. A

                                                                therefore have

   some point, but we are not privy to this information.                                             di  R

integrating each side of the equation. The variables in Eq. [1] are i and t, and
it is apparent that the equation may be multiplied by dt, divided by i, and
arranged with the variables separated:

                                i     L
    Since the current is I0 at t = 0 and i(t) at time t, we may equate the two
definite integrals which are obtained by integrating each side between the
corresponding limits:

After a little manipulation, we find that the current i(t) is given by
                               i(t) = I0 e−Rt/L                                    [3]
    We check our solution by first showing that substitution of Eq. [3] in
Eq. [1] yields the identity 0 = 0, and then showing that substitution of t = 0
in Eq. [3] produces i(0) = I0 . Both steps are necessary; the solution must
satisfy the differential equation which characterizes the circuit, and it must
also satisfy the initial condition.


                                                                                                                     EXAMPLE 8.1
 If the inductor of Fig. 8.2 has a current iL  2 A at t  0, find an
 expression for iL(t) valid for t > 0, and its value at t  200 μs.                                         50 mH

 This is the identical type of circuit just considered, so we expect an
 inductor current of the form

 where R = 200 , L = 50 mH and I0 is the initial current flowing
 through the inductor at t = 0. Thus,                                                     ■ FIGURE 8.2 A simple RL circuit in which energy is

      An Alternative Approach
      The solution may also be obtained by a slight variation of the method we
      just described. After separating the variables, we now also include a con-
      stant of integration. Thus,
                                          
                                  di          R
                                      =−         dt + K
                                   i          L

      and integration gives us
                                               R
                                       ln i = − t + K                            [4]
                                               L

          The constant K cannot be evaluated by substitution of Eq. [4] in the orig-
      inal differential equation [1]; the identity 0 = 0 will result, because Eq. [4]
      is a solution of Eq. [1] for any value of K (try it out on your own). The con-
      stant of integration must be selected to satisfy the initial condition
      i(0) = I0 . Thus, at t = 0, Eq. [4] becomes
                                              ln I0 = K

      and we use this value for K in Eq. [4] to obtain the desired response
                                              R
                                      ln i = − t + ln I0
                                              L
      or
                                           i(t) = I0 e−Rt/L
      as before.

      A More General Solution Approach
      Either of these methods can be used when the variables are separable, but
      this is not always the situation. In the remaining cases we will rely on a very
      powerful method, the success of which will depend upon our intuition or
      experience. We simply guess or assume a form for the solution and then test
      our assumptions, first by substitution in the differential equation, and then
      by applying the given initial conditions. Since we cannot be expected to
      guess the exact numerical expression for the solution, we will assume a so-
      lution containing several unknown constants and select the values for these
      constants in order to satisfy the differential equation and the initial condi-
      tions. Many of the differential equations encountered in circuit analysis
      have a solution which may be represented by the exponential function or by
      the sum of several exponential functions. Let us assume a solution of Eq. [1]
      in exponential form,
                                            i(t) = Aes1 t                        [5]
      where A and s1 are constants to be determined. After substituting this as-
      sumed solution in Eq. [1], we have
                                                 R
                                    As1 es1 t + A es1 t = 0

                                   L
   In order to satisfy this equation for all values of time, it is necessary that
A = 0, or s1 = −∞, or s1 = −R/L . But if A = 0 or s1 = −∞, then every
response is zero; neither can be a solution to our problem. Therefore, we                               Substitute the trial solution

A Direct Route: The Characteristic Equation
                                                                                                                      End.
In fact, there is a more direct route that we can take. In obtaining Eq. [7], we
solved                                                                                     ■ FIGURE 8.4 Flowchart for the general approach

which is known as the characteristic equation. We can obtain the charac-
teristic equation directly from the differential equation, without the need for
substitution of our trial solution. Consider the general first-order differential
equation
                                    df
                                a      + bf = 0
                                    dt
where a and b are constants. We substitute s1 for d f /dt and s 0 for f, result-
ing in
                            df
                        a      + b f = (as + b) f = 0
                            dt
From this we may directly obtain the characteristic equation
                                    as + b = 0

which has the single root s = −b/a. The solution to our differential equa-
tion is then
                                    f = Ae−bt/a
This basic procedure is easily extended to second-order differential equa-
tions, as we will explore in Chap. 9.

                         −10Ae−10t + 10Ae−10t = 0
   as expected.)
      We find A by setting t = 0 in Eq. [10] and employing the fact that
   v(0) = −96 V. Thus,
                                v(t) = −96e−10t                                  [11]
   and so v(0.2) = −12.99 V, down from a maximum of −96 V.
 Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
   Instead of writing a differential equation in v, we could have written
   our differential equation in terms of iL:
                                            di L
                          40i L + 10i L + 5      =0
                                             dt
   or
                                di L
                                     + 10i L = 0
                                dt
   which has the solution iL = Be−10t. With iL(0) = 2.4, we find that                                                 4⍀
   iL(t) = 2.4e−10t. Since v = −40iL, we once again obtain Eq. [11]. We                                                            iL

Accounting for the Energy
Before we turn our attention to the interpretation of the response, let us re-
turn to the circuit of Fig. 8.1, and check the power and energy relationships.
The power being dissipated in the resistor is
                           p R = i 2 R = I02 Re−2Rt/L
and the total energy turned into heat in the resistor is found by integrating
the instantaneous power from zero time to infinite time:
                         ∞                  ∞
                  wR =       p R dt = I02 R     e−2Rt/L dt
                           0                       0

                      = I02 R                e−2Rt/L 0 = L I02
                                    2R                   2
    This is the result we expect, because the total energy stored initially in
the inductor is 12 L I02 , and there is no longer any energy stored in the induc-
tor at infinite time since its current eventually drops to zero. All the initial
energy therefore is accounted for by dissipation in the resistor.

      8.2          PROPERTIES OF THE EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE
               •
      Let us now consider the nature of the response in the series RL circuit. We
      have found that the inductor current is represented by
                                           i(t) = I0 e−Rt/L
      At t = 0, the current has value I0, but as time increases, the current decreases
      and approaches zero. The shape of this decaying exponential is seen by the
      plot of i(t)/I0 versus t shown in Fig. 8.7. Since the function we are plotting is
      e−Rt/L , the curve will not change if R/L remains unchanged. Thus, the same
      curve must be obtained for every series R L circuit having the same L/R
      ratio. Let us see how this ratio affects the shape of the curve.

           0
      ■ FIGURE 8.7 A plot of e−Rt/L versus t.


           If we double the ratio of L to R, the exponent will be unchanged only if
      t is also doubled. In other words, the original response will occur at a later
      time, and the new curve is obtained by moving each point on the original
      curve twice as far to the right. With this larger L/R ratio, the current takes
      longer to decay to any given fraction of its original value. We might have a
      tendency to say that the “width’’ of the curve is doubled, or that the width is
      proportional to L/R. However, we find it difficult to define our term width,
      because each curve extends from t = 0 to ∞! Instead, let us consider the
      time that would be required for the current to drop to zero if it continued to
      drop at its initial rate.
           The initial rate of decay is found by evaluating the derivative at zero time:
                                                      
                              d i           R −Rt/L          R
                                        =− e              =−
                              dt I0 t=0       L         t=0      L
      We designate the value of time it takes for i/I0 to drop from unity to zero, as-
      suming a constant rate of decay, by the Greek letter τ (tau). Thus,

    The ratio L/R has the units of seconds, since the exponent −Rt/L must
be dimensionless. This value of time τ is called the time constant and is
shown pictorially in Fig. 8.8. The time constant of a series RL circuit may
be found graphically from the response curve; it is necessary only to draw
the tangent to the curve at t = 0 and determine the intercept of this tangent
line with the time axis. This is often a convenient way of approximating the
time constant from the display on an oscilloscope.

■ FIGURE 8.8 The time constant τ is L/R for a series RL circuit. It is the time required for the response
  curve to drop to zero if it decays at a constant rate equal to its initial rate of decay.


   An equally important interpretation of the time constant τ is obtained by
determining the value of i(t)/I0 at t = τ . We have
                 i(τ )
                       = e−1 = 0.3679                 or        i(τ ) = 0.3679I0
                  I0
     Thus, in one time constant the response has dropped to 36.8 percent of
its initial value; the value of τ may also be determined graphically from this
fact, as indicated by Fig. 8.9. It is convenient to measure the decay of the
current at intervals of one time constant, and recourse to a hand calculator
shows that i(t)/I0 is 0.3679 at t = τ , 0.1353 at t = 2τ , 0.04979 at t = 3τ ,
0.01832 at t = 4τ , and 0.006738 at t = 5τ . At some point three to five
time constants after zero time, most of us would agree that the current is a

                            it take for the current to decay to zero?’’ our answer might be, “About
                            five time constants.’’ At that point, the current is less than 1 percent of its
                            original value!

  COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
                             The transient analysis capability of PSpice is very useful when consider-
                             ing the response of source-free circuits. In this example, we make use of
                             a special feature that allows us to vary a component parameter, similar to
                             the way we varied the dc voltage in other simulations. We do this by
                             adding the component PARAM to our schematic; it may be placed any-
                             where, as we will not wire it into the circuit. Our complete RL circuit is
                             shown in Fig. 8.10, which includes an initial inductor current of 1 mA.
                                 In order to relate our resistor value to the proposed parameter
                             sweep, we must perform three tasks. First, we provide a name for our
                             parameter, which we choose to call Resistance for the sake of simplic-
                             ity. This is accomplished by double-clicking on the PARAMETERS:
                             label in the schematic, which opens the Property Editor for this pseudo-
                             component. Clicking on New Column results in the dialog box shown
                             in Fig. 8.11a, in which we enter Resistance under Name and a place-
                             holder value of 1 under Value. Our second task consists of linking the

clicking on the default value of R1 on the schematic, resulting in the
dialog box of Fig. 8.11b. Under Value, we simply enter {Resistance}.

■ FIGURE 8.11 (a) Add New Column dialog box in the Property Editor for PARAM. (b) Resistor

   Our third task consists of setting up the simulation, which includes
setting transient analysis parameters as well as the values we desire for
R1. Under PSpice we select New Simulation Profile (Fig. 8.12a), in
which we select Time Domain (Transient) for Analysis type, 300 ns
for Run to time, and tick the Parametric Sweep box under Options.
This last action results in the dialog box shown in Fig. 8.12b, in which
we select Global parameter for Sweep variable and enter Resistance
for Parameter name. The final setup step required is to select
Logarithmic under Sweep type, a Start value of 10, an End value
of 1000, and 1 Points/Decade; alternatively we could list the desired                                             (b)

lighting it; we select all three for this example. Upon selecting the

       three graphs at once, as shown (after labeling by hand) in Fig. 8.14.




       ■ FIGURE 8.14 Probe output for the three resistances.


          Why does a larger value of the time constant L/R produce a
       response curve that decays more slowly? Let us consider the effect of
       each element.
          In terms of the time constant τ, the response of the series R L circuit
       may be written simply as
                                     i(t) = I0 e−t/τ
          An increase in L allows a greater energy storage for the same initial
       current, and this larger energy requires a longer time to be dissipated in
       the resistor. We may also increase L/R by reducing R. In this case, the
       power flowing into the resistor is less for the same initial current; again,
       a greater time is required to dissipate the stored energy. This effect is
       seen clearly in our simulation result of Fig. 8.14.




      8.3       THE SOURCE-FREE RC CIRCUIT
            •
      Circuits based on resistor-capacitor combinations are more common than
      their resistor-inductor analogs. The principal reasons for this are the smaller
      losses present in a physical capacitor, lower cost, better agreement between
      the simple mathematical model and the actual device behavior, and also
      smaller size and lighter weight, both of which are particularly important for
      integrated-circuit applications.

shows that the replacement of i by v and L/R by RC produces the identical
equation we considered previously. It should, for the RC circuit we are now
analyzing is the dual of the RL circuit we considered first. This duality
forces v(t) for the RC circuit and i(t) for the R L circuit to have identical
expressions if the resistance of one circuit is equal to the reciprocal of the
resistance of the other circuit, and if L is numerically equal to C. Thus, the
response of the R L circuit
                       i(t) = i(0)e−Rt/L = I0 e−Rt/L
enables us to immediately write
                       v(t) = v(0)e−t/RC = V0 e−t/RC                           [14]
for the RC circuit.
    Suppose instead that we had selected the current i as our variable in the
RC circuit, rather than the voltage v. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law,

                        C t0
we obtain an integral equation as opposed to a differential equation. How-
ever, taking the time derivative of both sides of this equation,

                               C       dt
and replacing i with v/R, we obtain Eq. [13] again:
                                 v     dv
                                    +      =0

Equation [15] could have been used as our starting point, but the application
of duality principles would not have been as natural.
    Let us discuss the physical nature of the voltage response of the RC circuit
as expressed by Eq. [14]. At t = 0 we obtain the correct initial condition, and
as t becomes infinite, the voltage approaches zero. This latter result agrees
with our thinking that if there were any voltage remaining across the capaci-
tor, then energy would continue to flow into the resistor and be dissipated as
heat. Thus, a final voltage of zero is necessary. The time constant of the RC

                circuit may be found by using the duality relationships on the expression for
                the time constant of the RL circuit, or it may be found by simply noting the
                time at which the response has dropped to 37 percent of its initial value:
                                                    τ

                so that
                                                             τ = RC                          [16]

                    Our familiarity with the negative exponential and the significance of the
                time constant τ enables us to sketch the response curve readily (Fig. 8.16).
                Larger values of R or C provide larger time constants and slower dissipation
                of the stored energy. A larger resistance will dissipate a smaller power with
                a given voltage across it, thus requiring a greater time to convert the stored
                energy into heat; a larger capacitance stores a larger energy with a given
                voltage across it, again requiring a greater time to lose this initial energy.

  EXAMPLE 8.3
                  For the circuit of Fig. 8.17a, find the voltage labeled v at t  200 μs.
                  To find the requested voltage, we will need to draw and analyze two
                  separate circuits: one corresponding to before the switch is thrown
                  (Fig. 8.17b), and one corresponding to after the switch is thrown
                  (Fig. 8.17c).
                     The sole purpose of analyzing the circuit of Fig. 8.17b is to obtain
                  an initial capacitor voltage; we assume any transients in that circuit
                  died out long ago, leaving a purely dc circuit. With no current through
                  either the capacitor or the 4  resistor, then,
                                                           v(0) = 9 V                       [17]
                      We next turn our attention to the circuit of Fig. 8.17c, recognizing that
                                   τ = RC = (2 + 4)(10 × 10−6 ) = 60 × 10−6 s
                      Thus, from Eq. [14],

8.4       A MORE GENERAL PERSPECTIVE
      •
As seen indirectly from Examples 8.2 and 8.3, regardless of how many re-
sistors we have in the circuit, we obtain a single time constant (either
τ = L/R or τ = RC) when only one energy storage element is present. We
can formalize this by realizing that the value needed for R is in fact the
Thévenin equivalent resistance seen by our energy storage element.
(Strange as it may seem, it is even possible to compute a time constant for a                                                    R3            L        iL

    A similar sequence of steps will provide a rapid solution to a large num-
ber of problems. We first recognize the time dependence of the response as
an exponential decay, determine the appropriate time constant by combin-
ing resistances, write the solution with an unknown amplitude, and then de-
termine the amplitude from a given initial condition.
    This same technique can be applied to any circuit with one inductor and
any number of resistors, as well as to those special circuits containing two
or more inductors and also two or more resistors that may be simplified by
resistance or inductance combination to one inductor and one resistor.

                                                   We have now considered the task of finding the natural response of any
                                               circuit which can be represented by an equivalent inductor in series with an
                                               equivalent resistor. A circuit containing several resistors and several induc-
                                               tors does not always possess a form which allows either the resistors or the
                                               inductors to be combined into single equivalent elements. In such instances,
                                               there is no single negative exponential term or single time constant associ-
                                               ated with the circuit. Rather, there will, in general, be several negative

exponential terms, the number of terms being equal to the number of induc-
tors that remain after all possible inductor combinations have been made.

General RC Circuits
Many of the RC circuits for which we would like to find the natural response
contain more than a single resistor and capacitor. Just as we did for the RL cir-
cuits, we first consider those cases in which the given circuit may be reduced
to an equivalent circuit consisting of only one resistor and one capacitor.
    Let us suppose first that we are faced with a circuit containing a single
capacitor, but any number of resistors. It is possible to replace the two-
terminal resistive network which is across the capacitor terminals with an
equivalent resistor, and we may then write down the expression for the ca-
pacitor voltage immediately. In such instances, the circuit has an effective
time constant given by
                                         τ = Req C
where Req is the equivalent resistance of the network. An alternative per-
spective is that Req is in fact the Thévenin equivalent resistance “seen” by
the capacitor.
    If the circuit has more than one capacitor, but they may be replaced
somehow using series and/or parallel combinations with an equivalent
capacitance Ceq , then the circuit has an effective time constant given by
                                         τ = RCeq
with the general case expressed as
                                        τ = Req Ceq
It is worth noting, however, that parallel capacitors replaced by an equiva-
lent capacitance would have to have identical initial conditions.

 We first simplify the circuit of Fig. 8.22a to that of Fig. 8.22b, enabling
 us to write
                                     v = V0 e−t/Req C

          Every current and voltage in the resistive portion of the network must
       have the form Ae−t/Req C , where A is the initial value of that current or

          Our method can be applied to circuits with one energy storage element
      and one or more dependent sources as well. In such instances, we may write
      an appropriate KCL or KVL equation along with any necessary supporting
      equations, distill this down into a single differential equation, and extract
      the characteristic equation to find the time constant. Alternatively, we may
      begin by finding the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network con-
      nected to the capacitor or inductor, and use this in calculating the appropri-
      ate RL or RC time constant—unless the dependent source is controlled by a
      voltage or current associated with the energy storage element, in which case
      the Thévenin approach cannot be used.

     connected to the capacitor.


The dependent source is not controlled by a capacitor voltage or current,
so we can start by finding the Thévenin equivalent of the network to the
left of the capacitor. Connecting a 1 A test source as in Fig. 8.24b,
                                  Vx = (1 + 1.5i 1 )(30)
where

                            i1 =                        Vx =
                                       20       10 + 20      30
   Performing a little algebra, we find that Vx = −60 V, so the network
has a Thévenin equivalent resistance of −60  (unusual, but not im-
possible when dealing with a dependent source). Our circuit therefore
has a negative time constant
                           τ = −60(1 × 10−6 ) = −60 μs
The capacitor voltage is therefore
                                                        −6
                              vC (t) = Aet/60×10                    V
where A = vC (0+ ) = vC (0− ) = 2 V. Thus,
                                                       −6
                              vC (t) = 2et/60×10                    V                          [21]
which, interestingly enough is unstable: it grows exponentially with
time. This cannot continue indefinitely; one or more elements in the
circuit will eventually fail.

                                                   required to describe the behavior of the circuit (one time constant for each

                                                       As a parting comment, we should be wary of certain situations involving
                                                   only ideal elements which are suddenly connected together. For example,
                                                   we may imagine connecting two ideal capacitors in series having unequal
                                                   voltages prior to t = 0. This poses a problem using our mathematical model
                                                   of an ideal capacitor; however, real capacitors have resistances associated
                                                   with them through which energy can be dissipated.

                                                         •
                                                   We have been studying the response of RL and RC circuits when no sources
                                                   or forcing functions were present. We termed this response the natural
                                                   response, because its form depends only on the nature of the circuit. The
                                                   reason that any response at all is obtained arises from the presence of initial

energy storage within the inductive or capacitive elements in the circuit. In
some cases we were confronted with circuits containing sources and
switches; we were informed that certain switching operations were per-
formed at t = 0 in order to remove all the sources from the circuit, while
leaving known amounts of energy stored here and there. In other words, we
have been solving problems in which energy sources are suddenly removed
from the circuit; now we must consider that type of response which results
when energy sources are suddenly applied to a circuit.
    We will focus on the response which occurs when the energy sources
suddenly applied are dc sources. Since every electrical device is intended to
be energized at least once, and since most devices are turned on and off
many times in the course of their lifetimes, our study applies to many prac-
tical cases. Even though we are now restricting ourselves to dc sources,
there are still many cases in which these simpler examples correspond to the
operation of physical devices. For example, the first circuit we will analyze
could represent the buildup of the current when a dc motor is started. The
generation and use of the rectangular voltage pulses needed to represent a
number or a command in a microprocessor provide many examples in the
field of electronic or transistor circuitry. Similar circuits are found in the
synchronization and sweep circuits of television receivers, in communica-
tion systems using pulse modulation, and in radar systems, to name but a
few examples.
    We have been speaking of the “sudden application’’ of an energy source,
and by this phrase we imply its application in zero time.2 The operation of a
switch in series with a battery is thus equivalent to a forcing function which
is zero up to the instant that the switch is closed and is equal to the battery
voltage thereafter. The forcing function has a break, or discontinuity, at the
instant the switch is closed. Certain special forcing functions which are
discontinuous or have discontinuous derivatives are called singularity
functions, the two most important of these singularity functions being the
unit-step function and the unit-impulse function.
    We define the unit-step forcing function as a function of time which is
zero for all values of its argument less than zero and which is unity for all
positive values of its argument. If we let (t − t0 ) be the argument and rep-
resent the unit-step function by u, then u(t − t0 ) must be zero for all values
of t less than t0, and it must be unity for all values of t greater than t0. At
t = t0 , u(t − t0 ) changes abruptly from 0 to 1. Its value at t = t0 is not de-
fined, but its value is known for all instants of time that are arbitrarily close                                           u(t – t0)
to t = t0 . We often indicate this by writing u(t0− ) = 0 and u(t0+ ) = 1. The
concise mathematical definition of the unit-step forcing function is
                                                                                                                            1

(2) Of course, this is not physically possible. However, if the time scale over which such an event occurs is
very short compared to all other relevant time scales that describe the operation of a circuit, this is approxi-
mately true, and mathematically convenient.

                                                             We also note that the unit step need not be a time function. For example,
                                                             u(x − x0 ) could be used to denote a unit-step function where x might be a
                                                             distance in meters, for example, or a frequency.
                                                                 Very often in circuit analysis a discontinuity or a switching action takes
                                                             place at an instant that is defined as t = 0. In that case t0 = 0, and we then
                                                             represent the corresponding unit-step forcing function by u(t − 0), or more
            u(t)                                             simply u(t). This is shown in Fig. 8.27. Thus

                                                                The unit-step forcing function is in itself dimensionless. If we wish it to

                                                             Perhaps we should ask what physical source is the equivalent of this

                                                             voltage-current characteristics of the two networks are identical. For the step-
                                                             voltage source of Fig. 8.28a, the voltage-current characteristic is simple:
                                                             the voltage is zero prior to t = 0.2 s, it is 5 V after t = 0.2 s, and the current
                                                             may be any (finite) value in either time interval. Our first thoughts might
                                                             produce the attempt at an equivalent shown in Fig. 8.28b, a 5 V dc source in
                                                             series with a switch which closes at t = 0.2 s. This network is not equiva-

                                                             switch is completely unspecified in this time interval. The “equivalent’’

   If we have a sinusoidal voltage source Vm sin ωt which is suddenly con-
nected to a network at t = t0 , then an appropriate voltage forcing function
would be v(t) = Vm u(t − t0 ) sin ωt . If we wish to represent one burst of en-
ergy from the transmitter for a radio-controlled car operating at 47 MHz
(295 Mrad/s), we may turn the sinusoidal source off 70 ns later by a second
unit-step forcing function.4 The voltage pulse is thus
           v(t) = Vm [u(t − t0 ) − u(t − t0 − 7 × 10−8 )] sin(295 × 106 t)
This forcing function is sketched in Fig. 8.32.

(3) The equivalent can be drawn if the current through the switch prior to t = t0 is known.
(4) Apparently, we’re pretty good at the controls of this car. A reaction time of 70 ns?

                                                           a dc source. The circuit consists of a battery whose voltage is V0 in series
                                                           with a switch, a resistor R, and an inductor L. The switch is closed at t = 0,

                 +                                         as indicated on the circuit diagram of Fig. 8.33a. It is evident that the cur-

                                                           and switch by a voltage-step forcing function V0 u(t), which also produces
                                                           no response prior to t = 0. After t = 0, the two circuits are clearly identical.

     The variables may be separated in several simple algebraic steps, yielding

and each side may be integrated directly:

                                R
    In order to evaluate k, an initial condition must be invoked. Prior to
t = 0, i(t) is zero, and thus i(0− ) = 0. Since the current in an inductor
cannot change by a finite amount in zero time without being associated with
an infinite voltage, we thus have i(0+ ) = 0. Setting i = 0 at t = 0, we obtain
                                      L
                                  −     ln V0 = k
                                      R
and, hence,
                            L
                        −     [ln(V0 − Ri) − ln V0 ] = t
                            R
Rearranging,
                                 V0 − Ri
                                         = e−Rt/L

A More Direct Procedure
This is the desired solution, but it has not been obtained in the simplest man-
ner. In order to establish a more direct procedure, let us try to interpret the two
terms appearing in Eq. [25]. The exponential term has the functional form of
the natural response of the RL circuit; it is a negative exponential, it ap-
proaches zero as time increases, and it is characterized by the time constant
LR. The functional form of this part of the response is thus identical with
that which is obtained in the source-free circuit. However, the amplitude
of this exponential term depends on the source voltage V0. We might gener-
alize, then, that the response will be the sum of two terms, where one term has
a functional form identical to that of the source-free response, but has an am-
plitude that depends on the forcing function. But what of the other term?
    Equation [25] also contains a constant term, V0 /R. Why is it present?
The answer is simple: the natural response approaches zero as the energy is
gradually dissipated, but the total response must not approach zero. Eventu-
ally the circuit behaves as a resistor and an inductor in series with a battery.
Since the inductor looks like a short circuit to dc, the only current now
288                                              CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS


                                                 flowing is V0 /R. This current is a part of the response that is directly attrib-
                                                 utable to the forcing function, and we call it the forced response. It is the
                                                 response that is present a long time after the switch is closed.
                                                     The complete response is composed of two parts, the natural response
                                                 and the forced response. The natural response is a characteristic of the cir-
                                                 cuit and not of the sources. Its form may be found by considering the
                                                 source-free circuit, and it has an amplitude that depends on both the initial
                                                 amplitude of the source and the initial energy storage. The forced response
                                                 has the characteristics of the forcing function; it is found by pretending that
                                                 all switches were thrown a long time ago. Since we are presently concerned
                                                 only with switches and dc sources, the forced response is merely the solu-
                                                 tion of a simple dc circuit problem.

Developing an Intuitive Understanding
The reason for the two responses, forced and natural, may be seen from
physical arguments. We know that our circuit will eventually assume the
forced response. However, at the instant the switches are thrown, the initial
inductor currents (or, in RC circuits, the voltages across the capacitors) will
have values that depend only on the energy stored in these elements. These
currents or voltages cannot be expected to be the same as the currents and
voltages demanded by the forced response. Hence, there must be a transient
period during which the currents and voltages change from their given ini-
tial values to their required final values. The portion of the response that
provides the transition from initial to final values is the natural response
(often called the transient response, as we found earlier). If we describe the
response of the simple source-free RL circuit in these terms, then we should
say that the forced response is zero and that the natural response serves to
connect the initial response dictated by the stored energy with the zero value
of the forced response.
    This description is appropriate only for those circuits in which the nat-
ural response eventually dies out. This always occurs in physical circuits
where some resistance is associated with every element, but there are a
number of “pathologic’’ circuits in which the natural response is nonvan-
ishing as time becomes infinite. Those circuits in which trapped currents
circulate around inductive loops, or voltages are trapped in series strings of
capacitors, are examples.


8.7       NATURAL AND FORCED RESPONSE
      •
There is also an excellent mathematical reason for considering the complete
response to be composed of two parts—the forced response and the natural
response. The reason is based on the fact that the solution of any linear
differential equation may be expressed as the sum of two parts: the comple-
mentary solution (natural response) and the particular solution (forced
response). Without delving into the general theory of differential equations,
let us consider a general equation of the type met in the previous section:
                                   di
                                      + Pi = Q
                                   dt
or
                                di + Pi dt = Q dt                               [28]
   We may identify Q as a forcing function and express it as Q(t) to em-
phasize its general time dependence. Let us simplify the discussion by
290   CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS


      assuming that P is a positive constant. Later, we will also assume that Q is
      constant, thus restricting ourselves to dc forcing functions.
          In any standard text on elementary differential equations, it is shown
      that if both sides of Eq. [28] are multiplied by a suitable “integrating factor,”
      then each side becomes an exact differential that can be integrated directly
      to obtain the solution. We are not separating the variables, but merely ar-
      ranging them in such a way that integration is possible. For this equation,
      the integrating factor is e P dt or simply e Pt , since P is a constant. We mul-
      tiply each side of the equation by this integrating factor and obtain
                                       e Pt di + iPe Pt dt = Qe Pt dt                               [29]
          The form of the left side may be simplified by recognizing it as the exact
      differential of ie Pt :
                                        d(ie Pt ) = e Pt di + iPe Pt dt
      so that Eq. [29] becomes
                                                d(ie Pt ) = Qe Pt dt
      Integrating each side,
                                                         
                                                Pt
                                           ie        =       Qe Pt dt + A

      where A is a constant of integration. Multiplication by e−Pt produces the so-
      lution for i(t),
                                       
                             i = e−Pt Qe Pt dt + Ae−Pt                        [30]

          If our forcing function Q(t) is known, then we can obtain the functional
      form of i(t) by evaluating the integral. We will not evaluate such an integral
      for each problem, however; instead, we are interested in using Eq. [30] to
      draw several very general conclusions.

      The Natural Response
      We note first that, for a source-free circuit, Q must be zero, and the solution
      is the natural response
                                                     i n = Ae−Pt                                    [31]
          We will find that the constant P is never negative for a circuit with only
      resistors, inductors, and capacitors; its value depends only on the passive
      circuit elements5 and their interconnection in the circuit. The natural re-
      sponse therefore approaches zero as time increases without limit. This must
      be the case for the simple RL circuit, because the initial energy is gradually
      dissipated in the resistor, leaving the circuit in the form of heat. There are
      also idealized circuits in which P is zero; in these circuits the natural re-
      sponse does not die out.
          We therefore find that one of the two terms making up the complete re-
      sponse has the form of the natural response; it has an amplitude which will

      (5) If the circuit contains a dependent source or a negative resistance, P may be negative.

depend on (but not always be equal to) the initial value of the complete
response and thus on the initial value of the forcing function also.

The Forced Response
We next observe that the first term of Eq. [30] depends on the functional
form of Q(t), the forcing function. Whenever we have a circuit in which the
natural response dies out as t becomes infinite, this first term must com-
pletely describe the form of the response after the natural response has dis-
appeared. This term is typically called the forced response; it is also called
the steady-state response, the particular solution, or the particular integral.
    For the present, we have elected to consider only those problems in-
volving the sudden application of dc sources, and Q(t) will therefore be a
constant for all values of time. If we wish, we can now evaluate the integral
in Eq. [30], obtaining the forced response
                                         Q
                                    if =                                   [32]
                                         P
and the complete response
                                      Q
                             i(t) =     + Ae−Pt                             [33]
                                      P
    For the RL series circuit, Q/P is the constant current V0 /R and 1/P is
the time constant τ . We should see that the forced response might have been
obtained without evaluating the integral, because it must be the complete
response at infinite time; it is merely the source voltage divided by the series
resistance. The forced response is thus obtained by inspection of the final
circuit.

Determination of the Complete Response
Let us use the simple RL series circuit to illustrate how to determine the                                    i (t)
complete response by the addition of the natural and forced responses. The
circuit shown in Fig. 8.35 was analyzed earlier, but by a longer method.                                               R

where the amplitude A is yet to be determined; since the initial condition
applies to the complete response, we cannot simply assume A = i(0).
    We next consider the forced response. In this particular problem the
forced response must be constant, because the source is a constant V0 for all
positive values of time. After the natural response has died out, there can be
no voltage across the inductor; hence, a voltage V0 appears across R, and the
forced response is simply

 and recall that
                                   i = i f + in

 The natural response is therefore a negative exponential as before:
                        i n = Ke−t/2         A       t >0

 Since the forcing function is a dc source, the forced response will be a
 constant current. The inductor acts like a short circuit to dc, so that
                                 i f = 100
                                        2
                                           = 50 A

 Thus,
                     i = 50 + K e−0.5t           A      t >0

    In order to evaluate K, we must establish the initial value of the
 inductor current. Prior to t = 0, this current is 25 A, and it cannot
 change instantaneously. Thus,
                                  25 = 50 + K

 or
                                    K = −25

 Hence,
                                                                                                                          Forced response

 We complete the solution by also stating                                                           50

 or by writing a single expression valid for all t,
                                                                                                                                           t (s)

    The left curve is drawn for the case where the time constant is only one-
half as large as the length of the applied pulse; the rising portion of the
exponential has therefore almost reached V0 /R before the decaying expo-
nential begins. The opposite situation is shown to the right; there, the time
constant is twice t0 and the response never has a chance to reach the larger
amplitudes.
    The procedure we have been using to find the response of an RL circuit
after dc sources have been switched on or off (or in or out of the circuit) at
some instant of time is summarized in the following. We assume that the
circuit is reducible to a single equivalent resistance Req in series with a sin-
gle equivalent inductance L eq when all independent sources are set equal to
zero. The response we seek is represented by f (t).


  1. With all independent sources zeroed out, simplify the circuit to
     determine Req , L eq , and the time constant τ = L eq /Req .
  2. Viewing L eq as a short circuit, use dc analysis methods to find
     i L (0− ), the inductor current just prior to the discontinuity.
  3. Again viewing L eq as a short circuit, use dc analysis methods to
     find the forced response. This is the value approached by f (t) as
     t → ∞; we represent it by f (∞).
  4. Write the total response as the sum of the forced and natural
     responses: f (t) = f (∞) + Ae−t/τ .
  5. Find f (0+ ) by using the condition that i L (0+ ) = i L (0− ). If
     desired, L eq may be replaced by a current source i L (0+ ) [an open
     circuit if i L (0+ ) = 0] for this calculation. With the exception of
     inductor currents (and capacitor voltages), other currents and volt-
     ages in the circuit may change abruptly.
  6. f (0+ ) = f (∞) + A and f (t) = f (∞) + [ f (0+ ) − f (∞)] e−t/τ ,
     or total response = final value + (initial value − final value) e−t/τ .

The complete response of any RC circuit may also be obtained as the sum
of the natural and the forced response. Since the procedure is virtually
identical to what we have already discussed in detail for RL circuits, the best
approach at this stage is to illustrate it by working a relevant example com-
pletely, where the goal is not just a capacitor-related quantity but the current
associated with a resistor as well.

                  We begin by considering the state of the circuit at t < 0, corresponding
                  to the switch at position a as represented in Fig. 8.42b. As usual, we
                  assume no transients are present, so that only a forced response due to
                  the 120 V source is relevant to finding vC (0− ). Simple voltage division
                  then gives us the initial voltage,
                                                    50
                                      vC (0) =           (120) = 100 V
                                                 50 + 10
                  Since the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, this voltage
                  is equally valid at t = 0− and t = 0+ .
                      The switch is now thrown to b, and the complete response is
                                                           vC = vC f + vCn

    The corresponding circuit has been redrawn in Fig. 8.42c for conve-
nience. The form of the natural response is obtained by replacing the
50 V source by a short circuit and evaluating the equivalent resistance
to find the time constant (in other words, we are finding the Thévenin
equivalent resistance “seen’’ by the capacitor):
                                     1
                     Req = 1         1    1

                                  + 200 + 60
Thus,
                      vCn = Ae−t/Req C = Ae−t/1.2
   In order to evaluate the forced response with the switch at b, we wait
until all the voltages and currents have stopped changing, thus treating
the capacitor as an open circuit, and use voltage division once more:

                        60 + (50)(200)/250
Consequently,
                      vC = 20 + Ae−t/1.2           V
and from the initial condition already obtained,
                             100 = 20 + A

    Next we attack i(t). This response need not remain constant during

          To evaluate A, we need to know i(0+ ). This is found by fixing our
       attention on the energy-storage element (the capacitor). The fact that
       vC must remain 100 V during the switching interval is the governing
       condition which establishes the other currents and voltages at t = 0+ .
       Since vC (0+ ) = 100 V, and since the capacitor is in parallel with the
       200  resistor, we find i(0+ ) = 0.5 ampere, A = 0.4 ampere, and thus
                                      i(t) = 0.1923 ampere      t <0

                           i(t) = 0.1 + 0.4e−t/1.2          ampere       t >0
       or
               i(t) = 0.1923 + (−0.0923 + 0.4e−t/1.2 )u(t)                 amperes
       where the last expression is correct for all t.
          The complete response for all t may also be written concisely by
       using u(−t), which is unity for t < 0 and 0 for t > 0. Thus,
               i(t) = 0.1923u(−t) + (0.1 + 0.4e−t/1.2 )u(t)                amperes
          This response is sketched in Fig. 8.43b. Note that only four numbers
       are needed to write the functional form of the response for this single-
       energy-storage-element circuit, or to prepare the sketch: the constant
       value prior to switching (0.1923 ampere), the instantaneous value just
       after switching (0.5 ampere), the constant forced response (0.1 ampere),
       and the time constant (1.2 s). The appropriate negative exponential
       function is then easily written or drawn.

          We conclude by listing the duals of the statements given at the end of
      Sec. 8.7.
          The procedure we have been using to find the response of an RC circuit
      after dc sources have been switched on or off, or in or out of the circuit, at
      some instant of time, say t = 0, is summarized in the following. We assume
      that the circuit is reducible to a single equivalent resistance Req in parallel
      with a single equivalent capacitance Ceq when all independent sources are
      set equal to zero. The response we seek is represented by f (t).
                                                     SECTION 8.8 DRIVEN RC CIRCUITS                                                    299


  1. With all independent sources zeroed out, simplify the circuit to
     determine Req , Ceq , and the time constant τ = Req Ceq .
  2. Viewing Ceq as an open circuit, use dc analysis methods to find
     vC (0− ), the capacitor voltage just prior to the discontinuity.
  3. Again viewing Ceq as an open circuit, use dc analysis methods to
     find the forced response. This is the value approached by f (t) as
     t → ∞; we represent it by f (∞).
  4.   Write the total response as the sum of the forced and natural
       responses: f (t) = f (∞) + Ae−t/τ .
  5.   Find f (0+ ) by using the condition that vC (0+ ) = vC (0− ). If
       desired, Ceq may be replaced by a voltage source vC (0+ ) [a short
       circuit if vC (0+ ) = 0] for this calculation. With the exception of
       capacitor voltages (and inductor currents), other voltages and cur-
       rents in the circuit may change abruptly.
  6.    f (0+ ) = f (∞) + A and f (t) = f (∞) + [ f (0+ ) − f (∞)]e−t/τ ,
       or total response = final value + (initial value − final value) e−t/τ .

   As we have just seen, the same basic steps that apply to the analysis of
R L circuits can be applied to RC circuits as well. Up to now, we have con-
fined ourselves to the analysis of circuits with dc forcing functions only, de-
spite the fact that Eq. [30] holds for more general functions such as
Q(t) = 9 cos(5t − 7o ) or Q(t) = 2e−5t . Before concluding this section, we
explore one such non-dc scenario.

                                                                                                             EXAMPLE 8.11
 Determine an expression for v(t) in the circuit of Fig. 8.45 valid
 for t > 0.
 Based on experience, we expect a complete response of the form
                           v(t) = v f + vn
 where v f will likely resemble our forcing function and vn will have the
 form Ae−t/τ .                                                                                                          10 ⍀

                                                     In Example 8.9 we briefly considered the response of an RL circuit to a
                                                     pulse waveform, in which a source was effectively switched into and sub-
                                                     sequently switched out of the circuit. This type of situation is common in
                                                     practice, as few circuits are designed to be energized only once (passenger
                                                     vehicle airbag triggering circuits, for example). In predicting the response
                                                     of simple R L and RC circuits subjected to pulses and series of pulses—
                                                     sometimes referred to as sequentially switched circuits—the key is the rel-
                                                     ative size of the circuit time constant to the various times that define the
                                                     pulse sequence. The underlying principle behind the analysis will be whether
                                                     the energy storage element has time to fully charge before the pulse ends,
                                                     and whether it has time to fully discharge before the next pulse begins.
                                                         Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 8.47a, which is connected to a pulsed
                                                     voltage source described by seven separate parameters defined in
                                                     Fig. 8.47b. The waveform is bounded by two values, V1 and V2. The time
                                                     tr required to change from V1 to V2 is called the rise time (TR), and
                                                     the time t f required to change from V2 to V1 is called the fall time (TF).
                                                     The duration W p of the pulse is referred to as the pulse width (PW), and the
                                                     period T of the waveform (PER) is the time it takes for the pulse to repeat.
                                                     Note also that SPICE allows a time delay (TD) before the pulse train

begins, which can be useful in allowing initial transient responses to decay
for some circuit configurations.
     For the purposes of this discussion, we set a zero time delay, V1 = 0,
and V2 = 9 V. The circuit time constant is τ = RC = 1 ms, so we set the
rise and fall times to be 1 ns. Although SPICE will not allow a voltage to
change in zero time since it solves the differential equations using discrete
time intervals, compared to our circuit time constant 1 ns is a reasonable ap-
proximation to “instantaneous.”
     We will consider four basic cases, summarized in Table 8.1. In the first
two cases, the pulse width W p is much longer than the circuit time constant
τ , so we expect the transients resulting from the beginning of the pulse to
die out before the pulse is over. In the latter two cases, the opposite is true:
the pulse width is so short that the capacitor does not have time to fully
charge before the pulse ends. A similar issue arises when we consider the re-
sponse of the circuit when the time between pulses (T − W p ) is either short
(Case II) or long (Case III) compared to the circuit time constant.

      ■ FIGURE 8.48 Capacitor voltage for the RC circuit, with pulse width and period as in (a) Case I;
        (b) Case II; (c) Case III; and (d ) Case IV.


      In Case I, the capacitor has time to both fully charge and fully discharge
      (Fig. 8.48a), whereas in Case II (Fig. 8.48b), when the time between pulses
      is reduced, it no longer has time to fully discharge. In contrast, the capaci-
      tor does not have time to fully charge in either Case III (Fig. 8.48c) or
      Case IV (Fig. 8.48d).

      Case I: Time Enough to Fully Charge
      and Fully Discharge
      We can obtain exact values for the response in each case, of course, by per-
      forming a series of analyses. We consider Case I first. Since the capacitor
      has time to fully charge, the forced response will correspond to the 9 V dc
      driving voltage. The complete response to the first pulse is therefore
                                     vC (t) = 9 + Ae−1000t                V
      With vC (0) = 0, A = −9 V and so
                                    vC (t) = 9(1 − e−1000t )               V                              [39]
      in the interval of 0 < t < 10 ms. At t = 10 ms, the source drops suddenly
      to 0 V, and the capacitor begins to discharge through the resistor. In this time
      interval we are faced with a simple “source-free” RC circuit, and we can
      write the response as
                          vC (t) = Be−1000(t−0.01)               10 < t < 20 ms                           [40]
      where B = 8.99959 V is found by substituting t = 10 ms in Eq. [39]; we
      will be pragmatic here and round this to 9 V, noting that the value calculated
      is consistent with our assumption that the initial transient dissipates before
      the pulse ends.
          At t = 20 ms, the voltage source jumps immediately back to 9 V. The
      capacitor voltage just prior to this event is given by substituting t = 20 ms
      in Eq. [40], leading to vC (20 ms) = 408.6 μV, essentially zero compared to
      the peak value of 9 V.
                SECTION 8.9 PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF SEQUENTIALLY SWITCHED CIRCUITS        303

   If we keep to our convention of rounding to four significant digits, the
capacitor voltage at the beginning of the second pulse is zero, which is the
same as our starting point. Thus, Eqs. [39] and [40] form the basis of the re-
sponse for all subsequent pulses, and we may write
                   ⎧

                     9e               V          30 < t ≤ 40 ms
and so on.

Case II: Time Enough to Fully Charge But
Not Fully Discharge
Next we consider what happens if the capacitor is not allowed to completely
discharge (Case II). Equation [39] still describes the situation in the interval
of 0 < t < 10 ms, and Eq. [40] describes the capacitor voltage in the inter-
val between pulses, which has been reduced to 10 < t < 10.1 ms.
    Just prior to the onset of the second pulse at t = 10.1 ms, vC is now
8.144 V; the capacitor has only had 0.1 ms to discharge, and therefore still
retains 82 percent of its maximum energy when the next pulse begins. Thus,
in the next interval,
                                         −3
      vC (t) = 9 + Ce−1000(t−10.1×10 )                 V         10.1 < t < 20.1 ms
where vC (10.1 ms) = 9 + C = 8.144 V, so C = −0.856 V and
                                              −3
   vC (t) = 9 − 0.856e−1000(t−10.1×10 )                    V       10.1 < t < 20.1 ms
which reaches the peak value of 9 V much more quickly than for the previ-
ous pulse.

Case III: No Time to Fully Charge But Time
to Fully Discharge
What if it isn’t clear that the transient will dissipate before the end of the volt-
age pulse? In fact, this situation arises in Case III. Just as we wrote for Case I,
                         vC (t) = 9 + Ae−1000t                   V                    [41]
still applies to this situation, but now only in the interval 0 < t < 0.1 ms.
Our initial condition has not changed, so A = −9 V as before. Now, how-
ever, just before this first pulse ends at t = 0.1 ms, we find that
vC = 0.8565 V. This is a far cry from the maximum of 9 V possible if we
allow the capacitor time to fully charge, and is a direct result of the pulse
lasting only one-tenth of the circuit time constant.
     The capacitor now begins to discharge, so that
                                    −4
          vC (t) = Be−1000(t−1×10 )                V           0.1 < t < 10.1 ms      [42]
                                                                   −
    We have already determined that vC (0.1 ms) = 0.8565 V, so
vC (0.1+ ms) = 0.8565 V and substitution into Eq. [42] yields B = 0.8565 V.
Just prior to the onset of the second pulse at t = 10.1 ms, the capacitor volt-
age has decayed to essentially 0 V; this is the initial condition at the start of
the second pulse and so Eq. [41] can be rewritten as
                                         −3
      vC (t) = 9 − 9e−1000(t−10.1×10 )                 V         10.1 < t < 10.2 ms [43]
to describe the corresponding response.
304         CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS


            Case IV: No Time to Fully Charge or Even
            Fully Discharge
            In the last case, we consider the situation where the pulse width and period
            are so short that the capacitor can neither fully charge nor fully discharge in
            any one period. Based on experience, we can write
                    vC (t) = 9 − 9e−1000t                 V                    0 < t < 0.1 ms                 [44]
                                                              −4
                    vC (t) = 0.8565e−1000(t−1×10 )                     V       0.1 < t < 0.2 ms               [45]
                                          −1000(t−2×10−4 )
                    vC (t) = 9 + Ce                                    V       0.2 < t < 0.3 ms               [46]
                                                     −4
                    vC (t) = De−1000(t−3×10 )                      V           0.3 < t < 0.4 ms               [47]
                Just prior to the onset of the second pulse at t = 0.2 ms, the capacitor
            voltage has decayed to vC = 0.7750 V; with insufficient time to fully
            discharge, it retains a large fraction of the little energy it had time to
            store initially. For the interval of 0.2 < t < 0.3 ms, substitution of
            vC (0.2+ ) = vC (0.2− ) = 0.7750 V into Eq. [46] yields C = −8.225 V.
            Continuing, we evaluate Eq. [46] at t = 0.3 ms and calculate vC = 1.558 V
            just prior to the end of the second pulse. Thus, D = 1.558 V and our

capacitor is slowly charging to ever increase voltage levels over several
pulses. At this stage it might be useful if we plot the detailed responses, so
we show the PSpice simulation results of Cases I through IV in Fig. 8.49.
Note in particular that in Fig. 8.49d, the small charge/discharge transient
response similar in shape to that shown in Fig. 8.49a–c is superimposed on
a charging-type response of the form (1 − e−t/τ ). Thus, it takes about 3 to
5 circuit time constants for the capacitor to charge to its maximum value
in situations where a single period does not allow it to fully charge or
discharge!
    What we have not yet done is predict the behavior of the response for
t    5τ , although we would be interested in doing so, especially if it was not
necessary to consider a very long sequence of pulses one at a time. We note
that the response of Fig. 8.49d has an average value of 4.50 V from about
4 ms onward. This is exactly half the value we would expect if the voltage
source pulse width allowed the capacitor to fully charge. In fact, this long-
term average value can be computed by multiplying the dc capacitor volt-
age by the ratio of the pulse width to the period.

    We started our analysis with so-called source-free circuits to introduce
the idea of time constants without unnecessary distractions; such circuits
have zero forced response and a transient response derived entirely from the
energy stored at t = 0. We reasoned that a capacitor cannot change its volt-
age in zero time (or an infinite current results), and indicated this by intro-
ducing the notation vC (0+ ) = vC (0− ). Similarly, the current through an in-
ductor cannot change in zero time, or i L (0+ ) = i L (0− ). The complete
response is always the sum of the transient response and the forced re-
sponse. Applying the initial condition to the complete response allows us to
determine the unknown constant which multiplies the transient term.
    We spent a little time discussing modeling switches, both analytically
and within the context of PSpice. A common mathematical representation
makes use of the unit-step function u(t − t0 ), which has zero value for
t < t0 , unity value for t > t0 , and is indeterminate for t = t0 . Unit-step
308   CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS


      functions can “activate” a circuit (connecting sources so current can flow) for
      values of t preceding a specific time as well as after. Combinations of step
      functions can be used to create pulses and more complex waveforms. In the
      case of sequentially switched circuits, where sources are connected and dis-
      connected repeatedly, we found the behavior of the circuits to depend strongly
      on both period and pulse width as they compare to the circuit time constant.
         This is a good time to highlight some key points worth reviewing, along
      with relevant example(s).
      ❑   The response of a circuit having sources suddenly switched in or out of
          a circuit containing capacitors and inductors will always be composed
          of two parts: a natural response and a forced response.
      ❑   The form of the natural response (also referred to as the transient
          response) depends only on the component values and the way they are
          wired together. (Examples 8.1, 8.2)
      ❑   A circuit reduced to a single equivalent capacitance C and a single
          equivalent resistance R will have a natural response given by
          v(t) = V0 e−t/τ , where τ = RC is the circuit time constant.
          (Examples 8.3, 8.5)
      ❑   A circuit reduced to a single equivalent inductance L and a single
          equivalent resistance R will have a natural response given by
          i(t) = I0 e−t/τ , where τ = L/R is the circuit time constant.
          (Example 8.4)
      ❑   Circuits with dependent sources can be represented by a resistance
          using Thévenin procedures.
      ❑   The unit-step function is a useful way to model the closing or
          opening of a switch, provided we are careful to keep an eye on the
          initial conditions. (Examples 8.7, 8.9)
      ❑   The form of the forced response mirrors the form of the forcing
          function. Therefore, a dc forcing function always leads to a constant
          forced response. (Examples 8.7, 8.8)
      ❑   The complete response of an RL or RC circuit excited by a dc
          source will have the form f (0+ ) = f (∞) + A and f (t) = f (∞) +
          [ f (0+ ) − f (∞)]e−t/τ , or total response = final value +
          (initial value − final value)e−t/τ . (Examples 8.9, 8.10, 8.11)
      ❑   The complete response for an RL or RC circuit may also be determined
          by writing a single differential equation for the quantity of interest and
          solving. (Examples 8.2, 8.11)
      ❑   When dealing with sequentially switched circuits, or circuits connected
          to pulsed waveforms, the relevant issue is whether the energy storage
          element has sufficient time to fully charge and to fully discharge, as
          measured relative to the circuit time constant.

          properly absorbed; even metals can be partly transparent when rolled out into
          very thin foils. If the incident light flux (number of photons per unit area per
          unit time) at the solar cell surface (x = 0) is given by 0, and the intensity of
          light a distance x inside the solar cell is given by (x), the behavior of (x) is
          described by the equation d/dx + α = 0. Here, α, known as the absorption
          coefficient, is a constant specific to a given semiconductor material. (a) What

    down during manufacturing, so that the terminal corresponding to the
    arrowhead is actually wired to the negative reference terminal of the voltage
    source. This is not detected by the quality assurance team so the unit ships out

          determined how long it took either the capacitor or the inductor to      Overdamped Response

          analysis were always first-order. In this chapter, we consider more      Critically Damped Response

          The result is a second-order differential equation for any voltage or    Underdamped Response

          9.1 THE SOURCE-FREE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
              •
          There are two basic types of RLC circuits: parallel connected, and
          series connected. We could start with either, but somewhat arbitrar-
          ily choose to begin by considering parallel RLC circuits. This
          particular combination of ideal elements is a reasonable model for
          portions of many communication networks. It represents, for exam-
          ple, an important part of certain electronic amplifiers found in
          radios, and enables the amplifiers to produce a large voltage ampli-
          fication over a narrow band of signal frequencies (with almost zero
          amplification outside this band).
              Just as we did with RL and RC circuits, we first consider the nat-
          ural response of a parallel RLC circuit, where one or both of the

                                                                                                           321

                                                      energy storage elements have some nonzero initial energy (the origin of
                                                      which for now is unimportant). This is represented by the inductor current
                                                      and the capacitor voltage, both specified at t = 0+. Once we’re comfortable
                                                      with this part of RLC circuit analysis, we can easily include dc sources,
                                                      switches, or step sources in the circuit. Then we find the total response,
                                                      which will be the sum of the natural response and the forced response.
                                                          Frequency selectivity of this kind enables us to listen to the transmission
                                                      of one station while rejecting the transmission of any other station. Other ap-
                                                      plications include the use of parallel RLC circuits in frequency multiplexing
                                                      and harmonic-suppression filters. However, even a simple discussion of these
                                                      principles requires an understanding of such terms as resonance, frequency
                                                      response, and impedance, which we have not yet discussed. Let it suffice to
                                                      say, therefore, that an understanding of the natural behavior of the parallel
                             v                        RLC circuit is fundamentally important to future studies of communications

                                                      networks and filter design, as well as many other applications.
                                                          When a physical capacitor is connected in parallel with an inductor and
         R               L             C              the capacitor has associated with it a finite resistance, the resulting network
                                                      can be shown to have an equivalent circuit model like that shown in Fig. 9.1.
                                                      The presence of this resistance can be used to model energy loss in the

                                                      taken into account by adding an ideal resistor (in series with the ideal
                                                      inductor). For simplicity, however, we restrict our discussion to the case of an
                                                      essentially ideal inductor in parallel with a “leaky” capacitor.

                                                      for a Parallel RLC Circuit
                                                      In the following analysis we will assume that energy may be stored initially
                                                      in both the inductor and the capacitor; in other words, nonzero initial values
                                                      of both inductor current and capacitor voltage may be present. With reference
                                                      to the circuit of Fig. 9.1, we may then write the single nodal equation

                                                      We must solve Eq. [1] subject to the initial conditions
                                                                                        i(0+ ) = I0                                [2]

                                                      When both sides of Eq. [1] are differentiated once with respect to time, the re-

                                                      Solution of the Differential Equation
                                                      There are a number of interesting ways to solve Eq. [4]. Most of these methods
                                                      we will leave to a course in differential equations, selecting only the quickest
                                                      and simplest method to use now. We will assume a solution, relying upon our

intuition and modest experience to select one of the several possible forms that
are suitable. Our experience with first-order equations might suggest that we
at least try the exponential form once more. Thus, we assume
                                     v = Aest                                      [5]
being as general as possible by allowing A and s to be complex numbers if
necessary. Substituting Eq. [5] in Eq. [4], we obtain
                                  1          1
                     CAs 2 est + Asest + Aest = 0

or

                                       R      L
    In order for this equation to be satisfied for all time, at least one of the
three factors must be zero. If either of the first two factors is set equal to zero,
then v(t) = 0. This is a trivial solution of the differential equation which
cannot satisfy our given initial conditions. We therefore equate the remaining
factor to zero:
                                      1       1
                              Cs 2 + s + = 0                                     [6]
                                      R       L
This equation is usually called the auxiliary equation or the characteristic
equation, as we discussed in Sec. 8.1. If it can be satisfied, then our assumed
solution is correct. Since Eq. [6] is a quadratic equation, there are two solu-
tions, identified as s1 and s2:        

and                                     
                                                   2

                       s2 = −     −                      −                         [8]

If either of these two values is used for s in the assumed solution, then that
solution satisfies the given differential equation; it thus becomes a valid
solution of the differential equation.
    Let us assume that we replace s by s1 in Eq. [5], obtaining
                                    v1 = A1 es1 t
and, similarly,
                                    v2 = A2 es2 t
The former satisfies the differential equation

324   CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT


      Linearity triumphs, and it is seen that the sum of the two solutions is also a
      solution. We thus have the general form of the natural response
                                  v(t) = A1 es1 t + A2 es2 t                            [9]

      where s1 and s2 are given by Eqs. [7] and [8]; A1 and A2 are two arbi-
      trary constants which are to be selected to satisfy the two specified initial
      conditions.


      Definition of Frequency Terms
      The form of the natural response as given in Eq. [9] offers little insight into
      the nature of the curve we might obtain if v(t) were plotted as a function
      of time. The relative amplitudes of A1 and A2, for example, will certainly be
      important in determining the shape of the response curve. Furthermore, the
      constants s1 and s2 can be real numbers or conjugate complex numbers,
      depending upon the values of R, L, and C in the given network. These two
      cases will produce fundamentally different response forms. Therefore, it will
      be helpful to make some simplifying substitutions in Eq. [9].
          Since the exponents s1 t and s2 t must be dimensionless, s1 and s2 must
      have the unit of some dimensionless quantity “per second.”
                                                               √     From Eqs. [7]
      and [8] we therefore see that the units of 1/2RC and 1/ LC must also be s−1
      (i.e., seconds−1). Units of this type are called frequencies.
          Let us define a new term, ω0 (omega-sub-zero, or just omega-zero):
                                                 1
                                        ω0 = √                                      [10]
                                                 LC
      and reserve the term resonant frequency for it. On the other hand, we will call
      1/2RC the neper frequency, or the exponential damping coefficient, and
      represent it by the symbol α (alpha):
                                                1
                                         α=                                         [11]
                                               2RC
          This latter descriptive expression is used because α is a measure of how
      rapidly the natural response decays or damps out to its steady, final value
      (usually zero). Finally, s, s1, and s2, which are quantities that will form the ba-
      sis for some of our later work, are called complex frequencies.
          We should note that s1, s2, α, and ω0 are merely symbols used to simplify
      the discussion of RLC circuits; they are not mysterious new properties of any
      kind. It is easier, for example, to say “alpha” than it is to say “the reciprocal
      of 2RC.”
          Let us collect these results. The natural response of the parallel RLC
      circuit is
                                  v(t) = A1 es1 t + A2 es2 t                      [9]

                                   s2 = −α − α 2 − ω02                              [13]

and A1 and A2 must be found by applying the given initial conditions.                 Overdamped:            α > ω0
    We note two basic scenarios possible with Eqs. [12] and [13] depending            Critically damped:     α = ω0
on the relative sizes of α and ω0 (dictated by the values of R, L, and C). If         Underdamped:           α < ω0
α > ω0, s1 and s2 will both be real numbers, leading to what is referred to as
an overdamped response. In the opposite case, where α < ω0, both s1 and s2
will have nonzero imaginary components, leading to what is known as an
underdamped response. Both of these situations are considered separately in
the following sections, along with the special case of α = ω0, which leads to
what is called a critically damped response. We should also note that the gen-
eral response comprised by Eqs. [9] through [13] describes not only the volt-
age but all three branch currents in the parallel RLC circuit; the constants A1
and A2 will be different for each, of course.


                                                                                                                 EXAMPLE 9.1
 Consider a parallel RLC circuit having an inductance of 10 mH and
 a capacitance of 100 μF. Determine the resistor values that would
 lead to overdamped and underdamped responses.
 We first calculate the resonant frequency of the circuit:
                         
                   1                    1
         ω0 =          =                               = 103 rad/s
                  LC        (10 × 10 )(100 × 10−6 )
                                     −3


 An overdamped response will result if α > ω0 ; an underdamped
 response will result if α < ω0 . Thus,
                                  1
                                     > 103

 or
                                  R <5
 leads to an overdamped response; R > 5  leads to an underdamped
 response.

                                                        A comparison of Eqs. [10] and [11] shows that α will be greater than ω0 if

                                                        and both s1 and s2 will be real. Moreover, the following inequalities

                                                        may be applied to Eqs. [12] and [13] to show that both s1 and s2 are negative
                                                        real numbers. Thus, the response v(t) can be expressed as the (algebraic) sum
                                                        of two decreasing exponential terms, both of which approach zero as time in-
                                                        creases. In fact, since the absolute value of s2 is larger than that of s1, the term
                             v                          containing s2 has the more rapid rate of decrease, and, for large values of time,
                iR       i             iC               we may write the limiting expression

we obtain a second equation. Although this may appear to be helpful, we do
not have a numerical value for the initial value of the derivative, so we do not
yet have two equations in two unknowns . . . Or do we? The expression
dv/dt suggests a capacitor current, since

conservation of electrons. Thus, we may write

since zero initial voltage across the resistor requires zero initial current                               current at t = 0. It is the second condition that usually

 Identify the goal of the problem.
   We are asked to find the capacitor voltage after the switch is
   thrown. This action leads to no sources remaining connected to
   either the inductor or the capacitor.

328   CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT



       Collect the known information.
         After the switch is thrown, the capacitor is left in parallel with a
         200  resistor and a 5 mH inductor (Fig. 9.3b). Thus, α =1/2RC =
                                √
         125,000 s−1 , ω0 = 1/ LC =100,000 rad/s, s1 = −α + α 2 − ω02 =
         −50,000 s−1 and s2 = −α − α 2 − ω02 = −200,000 s−1 .
       Devise a plan.
         Since α > ω0 , the circuit is overdamped and so we expect a capacitor
         voltage of the form
                                           vC (t) = A1 es1 t + A2 es2 t
         We know s1 and s2; we need to obtain and invoke two initial condi-
         tions to determine A1 and A2. To do this, we will analyze the circuit at
         t = 0− (Fig. 9.4a) to find i L (0− ) and vC (0− ). We will then analyze
         the circuit at t = 0+ with the assumption that neither value changes.
       Construct an appropriate set of equations.
         From Fig. 9.4a, in which the inductor has been replaced with a short
         circuit and the capacitor with an open circuit, we see that
                                                         150

  In Fig. 9.4b, we draw the circuit at t = 0+ , representing the inductor
  current and capacitor voltage by ideal sources for simplicity. Since
  neither can change in zero time, we know that vC (0+ ) = 60 V.

 Determine if additional information is required.
  We have an equation for the capacitor voltage: vC (t) = A1 e−50,000t +
  A2 e−200,000t . We now know vC (0) = 60 V, but a third equation is still
  required. Differentiating our capacitor voltage equation, we find
            dvC
                  = −50,000A1 e−50,000t − 200,000A2 e−200,000t
             dt
  which can be related to the capacitor current as i C = C(dvC /dt).
  Returning to Fig. 9.4b, KCL yields
             i C (0+ ) = −i L (0+ ) − i R (0+ ) = 0.3 − [vC (0+ )/200] = 0

 Attempt a solution.
  Application of our first initial condition yields
                                 vC (0) = A1 + A2 = 60
  and application of our second initial condition yields
               i C (0) = −20 × 10−9 (50,000A1 + 200,000A2 ) = 0
  Solving, A1 = 80 V and A2 = −20 V, so that
                 vC (t) = 80e−50,000t − 20e−200,000t V,            t >0

 Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
  At the very least, we can check our solution at t = 0, verifying that
  vC (0) = 60 V. Differentiating and multiplying by 20 × 10−9 , we can
  also verify that i C (0) = 0. Also, since we have a source-free circuit
  for t > 0, we expect that vC(t) must eventually decay to zero as t
  approaches ∞, which our solution does.

                   As noted previously, the form of the overdamped response applies to any
                voltage or current quantity, as we explore in the following example.

                 For t > 0, we have a parallel RLC circuit with R = 30 k, L = 12 mH,
                 and C = 2 pF. Thus, α = 8.333 × 106 s−1 and ω0 = 6.455 × 106 rad/s.
                 We therefore expect an overdamped response, with s1 = −3.063 ×
                 106 s−1 and s2 = −13.60 × 106 s−1 , so that
                                       i R (t) = A1 es1 t + A2 es2 t ,             t >0                  [18]
                      To determine numerical values for A1 and A2, we first analyze the
                 circuit at t = 0− , as drawn in Fig. 9.6b. We see that i L (0− ) = i R (0− ) =
                 4/32 × 103 = 125 μA, and vC (0− ) = 4 × 30/32 = 3.75 V.
                      In drawing the circuit at t = 0+ (Fig. 9.6c), we only know that
                 i L (0+ ) = 125 μA and vC (0+ ) = 3.75 V. However, by Ohm’s law we
                 can calculate that i R (0+ ) = 3.75/30 × 103 = 125 μA, our first initial
                 condition. Thus,
                                           i R (0) = A1 + A2 = 125 × 10−6                                [19]

 How do we obtain a second initial condition? If we multiply Eq. [18]
 by 30 × 103 , we obtain an expression for vC (t). Taking the derivative
 and multiplying by 2 pF yield an expression for i C (t):

Graphical Representation of the
Overdamped Response
Now let us return to Eq. [17] and see what additional information we can de-
termine about this circuit. We may interpret the first exponential term as hav-
ing a time constant of 1 s and the other exponential, a time constant of 16 s.
Each starts with unity amplitude, but the latter decays more rapidly; v(t) is
never negative. As time becomes infinite, each term approaches zero, and the
response itself dies out as it should. We therefore have a response curve
which is zero at t = 0, is zero at t = ∞, and is never negative; since it is not
everywhere zero, it must possess at least one maximum, and this is not a
difficult point to determine exactly. We differentiate the response
                                  dv
                                     = 84(−e−t + 6e−6t )
                                  dt
set the derivative equal to zero to determine the time tm at which the voltage
becomes maximum,
                                     0 = −e−tm + 6e−6tm

                                                e5tm = 6
and obtain
                                           tm = 0.358 s

                A reasonable sketch of the response may be made by plotting the two
                exponential terms 84e−t and 84e−6t and then taking their difference. This
                technique is illustrated by the curves of Fig. 9.8; the two exponentials are
                shown lightly, and their difference, the total response v(t), is drawn as a col-
                ored line. The curves also verify our previous prediction that the functional
                behavior of v(t) for very large t is 84e−t , the exponential term containing the
                smaller magnitude of s1 and s2.

                     A frequently asked question is the length of time it actually takes for the
                transient part of the response to disappear (or “damp out”). In practice, it is
                often desirable to have this transient response approach zero as rapidly as
                possible, that is, to minimize the settling time ts. Theoretically, of course, ts
                is infinite, because v(t) never settles to zero in a finite time. However, a neg-
                ligible response is present after the magnitude of v(t) has settled to values
                that remain less than 1 percent of its maximum absolute value |vm |. The
                time that is required for this to occur we define as the settling time. Since
                |vm | = vm = 48.9 V for our example, the settling time is the time required
                for the response to drop to 0.489 V. Substituting this value for v(t) in
                Eq. [17] and neglecting the second exponential term, known to be negligi-
                ble here, the settling time is found to be 5.15 s.


  EXAMPLE 9.4
                 For t > 0, the capacitor current of a certain source-free parallel
                 RLC circuit is given by iC (t)  2e−2t − 4e−t A. Sketch the current
                 in the range 0 < t < 5 s, and determine the settling time.
                 We first sketch the two terms as shown in Fig. 9.9, then subtract them
                 to find iC(t). The maximum value is clearly |−2| = 2 A. We therefore
                 need to find the time at which |i C | has decreased to 20 mA, or

tion is not available, however, we can approximate Eq. [21] for t ≥ ts as

                                                                  At this point, some of us might be feeling that something’s wrong. We
                                                              have a response that contains only one arbitrary constant, but there are two
                                                              initial conditions, v(0) = 0 and i(0) = 10 amperes, both of which must be
                                                              satisfied by this single constant. If we select A3 = 0, then v(t) = 0, which is
                                                              consistent with our initial capacitor voltage. However, although there is no
                                                              energy stored in the capacitor at t = 0+, we have 350 J of energy initially
                                                              stored in the inductor. This energy will lead to a transient current flowing out
                                                              of the inductor, giving rise to a nonzero voltage across all three elements. This
                                                              seems to be in direct conflict with our proposed solution.
                                                          SECTION 9.3 CRITICAL DAMPING   335


   If a mistake has not led to our difficulties, we must have begun with an
incorrect assumption, and only one assumption has been made. We originally
hypothesized that the differential equation could be solved by assuming an
exponential solution, and this turns out to be incorrect for this single special
case of critical damping. When α = ω0, the differential equation, Eq. [4],
becomes
                          d 2v      dv
                             2
                               + 2α    + α2v = 0
                          dt        dt
    The solution of this equation is not a tremendously difficult process, but
we will avoid developing it here, since the equation is a standard type found
in the usual differential-equation texts. The solution is
                              v = e−αt (A1 t + A2 )                              [24]
    It should be noted that the solution is still expressed as the sum of two
terms, where one term is the familiar negative exponential and the second is
t times a negative exponential. We should also note that the solution contains
the two expected arbitrary constants.


Finding Values for A1 and A2
Let us now complete our numerical example. After we substitute the known
value of α in Eq. [24], obtaining
                                      √           √
                          v = A1 te− 6t + A2 e− 6t
we establish the values of A1 and A2 by first imposing the initial condition on
v(t) itself, v(0) = 0. Thus, A2 = 0. This simple result occurs because the ini-
tial value of the response v(t) was selected as zero; the more general case will
require the solution of two equations simultaneously. The second initial con-
dition must be applied to the derivative dv/dt just as in the overdamped case.
We therefore differentiate, remembering that A2 = 0:
                     dv          √    √          √
                        = A1 t (− 6)e− 6t + A1 e− 6t
                     dt

evaluate at t = 0:
                                     
                                 dv 
                                         = A1
                                 dt t=0

and express the derivative in terms of the initial capacitor current:
                         
                     dv        i C (0)   i R (0) i(0)
                              =          =        +
                     dt t=0        C         C       C

where reference directions for iC, iR, and i are defined in Fig. 9.2. Thus,
                                  A1 = 420 V
The response is, therefore,
                          v(t) = 420te−2.45t          V                          [25]
336   CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT


      Graphical Representation of the Critically
      Damped Response
      Before plotting this response in detail, let us again try to anticipate its form by
      qualitative reasoning. The specified initial value is zero, and Eq. [25] con-
      curs. It is not immediately apparent that the response also approaches zero as
      t becomes infinitely large, because te−2.45t is an indeterminate form. How-
      ever, this obstacle is easily overcome by use of L’Hôspital’s rule, which
      yields
                                                      t                     1
                   lim v(t) = 420 lim                         = 420 lim             =0
                   t→∞                      t→∞ e2.45t             t→∞ 2.45e2.45t

      and once again we have a response that begins and ends at zero and has posi-
      tive values at all other times. A maximum value vm again occurs at time tm; for
      our example,
                            tm = 0.408 s                  and      vm = 63.1 V
          This maximum is larger than that obtained in the overdamped case, and is
      a result of the smaller losses that occur in the larger resistor; the time of the
      maximum response is slightly later than it was with overdamping. The set-
      tling time may also be determined by solving
                                            vm
                                                = 420ts e−2.45ts
                                            100
      for ts (by trial-and-error methods or a calculator’s SOLVE routine):
                                                 ts = 3.12 s
      which is a considerably smaller value than that which arose in the over-
      damped case (5.15 s). As a matter of fact, it can be shown that, for given val-
      ues of L and C, the selection of that value of R which provides critical damp-
      ing will always give a shorter settling time than any choice of R that produces
      an overdamped response. However, a slight improvement (reduction) in set-
      tling time may be obtained by a further slight increase in resistance; a slightly
      underdamped response that will undershoot the zero axis before it dies out
      will yield the shortest settling time.

   The response curve for critical damping is drawn in Fig. 9.11; it may be
compared with the overdamped (and underdamped) case by reference to
Fig. 9.16.

            ■ FIGURE 9.12 A circuit that reduces to a parallel RLC circuit after
              the switch is thrown.


 We note that at t = 0− , the current source is on, and the inductor can be
 treated as a short circuit. Thus, v(0− ) appears across R2, and is given by
                                    v(0− ) = 5R2
 and a value of 400 m should be selected for R2 to obtain v(0) = 2 V.
    After the switch is thrown, the current source has turned itself off
 and R2 is shorted. We are left with a parallel RLC circuit comprised of
 R1, a 4 H inductor, and a 1nF capacitor.
    We may now calculate (for t > 0)

     Therefore, to establish a critically damped response in the circuit
 for t > 0, we need to set R1 = 31.63 k. (Note: since we have rounded
 to four significant figures, the pedantic can rightly argue that this is
 still not exactly a critically damped response—a difficult situation to
 create.)

                                                             ative. This causes the response to take on a much different character, but it is

                                                             and then let
                                                                                            √               

  Electrical engineers use “j” instead of “i” to represent
  √                                                                         √

                                                             call it ωd , the natural resonant frequency:
                                                                                                   

                                                             The response may now be written as

v(t) = e−αt (A1 + A2 )                         + j (A1 − A2 )

Applying identities described in Appendix 5, the term in the first square
brackets in the preceding equation is identically equal to cos ωd t, and the sec-
ond is identically sin ωd t. Hence,
          v(t) = e−αt [(A1 + A2 ) cos ωd t + j (A1 − A2 ) sin ωd t]
and the multiplying factors may be assigned new symbols:
                    v(t) = e−αt(B1 cos ωd t + B2 sin ωd t)                    [27]
where Eqs. [26] and [27] are identical.
     It may seem a little odd that our expression originally appeared to have a
complex component, and now is purely real. However, we should remember
that we originally allowed for A1 and A2 to be complex as well as s1 and s2. In
any event, if we are dealing with the underdamped case, we have now left
complex numbers behind. This must be true since α, ωd , and t are real quan-
tities, so that v(t) itself must be a real quantity (which might be presented on
an oscilloscope, a voltmeter, or a sheet of graph paper). Equation [27] is the
desired functional form for the underdamped response, and its validity may
be checked by direct substitution in the original differential equation; this
exercise is left to the doubters. The two real constants B1 and B2 are again
selected to fit the given initial conditions.
     We return to our simple parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 9.2 with R = 6 ,
C = 1/42 F, and L = 7 H, but now increase the resistance further to 10.5 .
Thus,

Except for the evaluation of the arbitrary constants, the response is now
known:

                 v(t) = e−2t (B1 cos 2t + B2 sin 2t)

Finding Values for B1 and B2
The determination of the two constants proceeds as before. If we still assume
that v(0) = 0 and i(0) = 10, then B1 must be zero. Hence

                               v(t) = 210 2e−2t sin 2t

      Graphical Representation of the Underdamped
      Response
      Notice that, as before, this response function has an initial value of zero
      because of the initial voltage condition we imposed, and a final value of zero
      because the exponential term vanishes for large values of t. As√t increases  √
      from zero through small positive values, v(t) increases as 210 2 sin 2t ,
      because the exponential term remains essentially equal to unity. But, at some
      time√ tm, the exponential function begins to decrease more rapidly than
      sin 2t is increasing; thus v(t) reaches a maximum vm and begins          √ to de-
      crease. We should note that tm is not the value √    of t for which sin 2t is a
      maximum, but must  √ occur somewhat before sin 2t reaches       √ its maximum.
                                                                                  √
          When t = π/ 2, v(t) is zero. Thus, in the interval    √  π/   2 < t < 2π,
      the response is negative, becoming zero again at t = 2π. Hence, v(t) is an
      oscillatory function
                         √ of time and crosses the time axis an infinite number of
      times at t = nπ/ 2, where n is any positive integer. In our example, how-
      ever, the response is only slightly underdamped, and the exponential term
      causes the function to die out so rapidly that most of the zero crossings will
      not be evident in a sketch.
          The oscillatory nature of the response becomes more noticeable as α de-
      creases. If α is zero, which corresponds to an infinitely large resistance, then
      v(t) is an undamped sinusoid that oscillates with constant amplitude. There
      is never a time at which v(t) drops and stays below 1 percent of its maximum
      value; the settling time is therefore infinite. This is not perpetual motion; we
      have merely assumed an initial energy in the circuit and have not provided
      any means to dissipate this energy. It is transferred from its initial location in
      the inductor to the capacitor, then returns to the inductor, and so on, forever.


      The Role of Finite Resistance
      A finite R in the parallel RLC circuit acts as a kind of electrical transfer agent.
      Every time energy is transferred from L to C or from C to L, the agent exacts a
      commission. Before long, the agent has taken all the energy, wantonly dissi-
      pating every last joule. The L and C are left without a joule of their own, with-
      out voltage and without current. Actual parallel RLC circuits can be made to
      have effective values of R so large that a natural undamped sinusoidal re-
      sponse can be maintained for years without supplying any additional energy.
          Returning to our specific numerical problem, differentiation locates the
      first maximum of v(t),
                          vm 1 = 71.8 V       at        tm 1 = 0.435 s
      the succeeding minimum,
                         vm 2 = −0.845 V           at     tm 2 = 2.66 s

and so on. The response curve is shown in Fig. 9.14. Additional response
curves for increasingly more underdamped circuits are shown in Fig. 9.15.

    The settling time may be obtained by a trial-and-error solution, and for
R = 10.5 , it turns out to be 2.92 s, somewhat smaller than for critical
damping. Note that ts is greater than tm 2 because the magnitude of vm 2 is
greater than 1 percent of the magnitude of vm 1 . This suggests that a slight de-
crease in R would reduce the magnitude of the undershoot and permit ts to be
less than tm 2 .
    The overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped responses for
this network as simulated by PSpice are shown on the same graph in
Fig. 9.16. A comparison of the three curves makes the following general

                conclusions plausible:
                •     When the damping is changed by increasing the size of the parallel
                      resistance, the maximum magnitude of the response is greater and the
                      amount of damping is smaller.
                •     The response becomes oscillatory when underdamping is present, and
                      the minimum settling time is obtained for slight underdamping.

  EXAMPLE 9.6
                    Determine iL(t) for the circuit of Fig. 9.17a, and plot the waveform.
                    At t = 0, both the 3 A source and the 48  resistor are removed,
                    leaving the circuit shown in Fig. 9.17b. Thus, α = 1.2 s−1 and
                    ω0 = 4.899 rad/s. Since α < ω0 , the circuit is underdamped, and
                    we therefore expect a response of the form
                                      i L (t) = e−αt(B1 cos ωd t + B2 sin ωd t)            [28]
                                   
                    where ωd = ω02 − α 2 = 4.750 rad/s. The only remaining step is to
                    find B1 and B2.
                         Figure 9.17c shows the circuit as it exists at t = 0− . We may replace
                    the inductor with a short circuit and the capacitor with an open circuit;
                    the result is vC (0− ) = 97.30 V and i L (0− ) = 2.027 A. Since neither
                    quantity can change in zero time, vC (0+ ) = 97.30 V and
                    i L (0+ ) = 2.027 A.
                         Substituting i L (0) = 2.027 into Eq. [28] yields B1 = 2.027 A. To
                    determine the other constant, we first differentiate Eq. [28]:

and note that v L (t) = L(di L /dt). Referring to the circuit of Fig. 9.17b,
we see that v L (0+ ) = vC (0+ ) = 97.3 V. Thus, multiplying Eq. [29] by

  COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
                             One useful feature in Probe is the ability to perform mathematical opera-
                             tions on the voltages and currents that result from a simulation. In this
                             example, we will make use of that ability to show the transfer of energy
                             in a parallel RLC circuit from a capacitor that initially stores a specific
                             amount of energy (1.25 μJ) to an inductor that initially stores no energy.
                                 We choose a 100 nF capacitor and a 7 μH inductor, which immedi-
                             ately enables us to calculate ω0 = 1.195 × 106 s−1 . In order to consider
                             overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped cases, we need to
                             select the parallel resistance in such a way as to obtain α > ω0 (over-
                             damped), α = ω0 (critically damped), and α < ω0 (underdamped).
                             From our previous discussions, we know that for a parallel RLC circuit
                             α = (2RC)−1 . We select R = 4.1833  as a close approximation to the
                             critically damped case; obtaining α precisely equal to ω0 is effectively
                             impossible. If we increase the resistance, the energy stored in the other
                             two elements is dissipated more slowly, resulting in an underdamped
                             response. We select R = 100  so that we are well into this regime, and
                             use R = 1  (a very small resistance) to obtain an overdamped response.
                                 We therefore plan to run three separate simulations, varying only the
                             resistance R between them. The 1.25 μJ of energy initially stored in the
                             capacitor equates to an initial voltage of 5 V, and so we set the initial
                             condition of our capacitor accordingly.
                                 Once Probe is launched, we select Add under the Trace menu. We
                             wish to plot the energy stored in both the inductor and the capacitor as
                             a function of time. For the capacitor, w = 12 Cv 2 , so we click in the
                             Trace Expression window, type in “0.5*100E-9*” (without the
                             quotes), click on V(C1:1), return to the Trace Expression window and
                             enter “*”, click on V(C1:1) once again, and then select Ok. We repeat
                             the sequence to obtain the energy stored in the inductor, using 7E-6
                             instead of 100E-9, and clicking on I(L1:1) instead of V(C1:1).

     The Probe output plots for three separate simulations are provided in
 Fig. 9.20. In Fig. 9.20a, we see that the energy remaining in the circuit is
 continuously transferred back and forth between the capacitor and the
 inductor until it is (eventually) completely dissipated by the resistor.
 Decreasing the resistance to 4.1833  yields a critically damped circuit,
 resulting in the energy plot of Fig. 9.20b. The oscillatory energy transfer
 between the capacitor and the inductor has been dramatically reduced. We
 see that the energy transferred to the inductor peaks at approximately
 0.8 μs, and then drops to zero. The overdamped response is plotted in
 Fig. 9.20c. We note that the energy is dissipated much more quickly in the
 case of the overdamped response, and that very little energy is transferred
 to the inductor, since most of it is now quickly dissipated in the resistor.

9.5 THE SOURCE-FREE SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
     •
We now wish to determine the natural response of a circuit model composed
of an ideal resistor, an ideal inductor, and an ideal capacitor connected in
series. The ideal resistor may represent a physical resistor connected into a
series LC or RLC circuit; it may represent the ohmic losses and the losses in
the ferromagnetic core of the inductor; or it may be used to represent all these
and other energy-absorbing devices.

    It is evident that if we work in terms of the parameters α, ω0, and ωd , the
mathematical forms of the responses for the dual situations are identical. An
increase in α in either the series or parallel circuit, while keeping ω0 constant,
tends toward an overdamped response. The only caution that we need exert is
in the computation of α, which is 1/2RC for the parallel circuit and R/2L for
the series circuit; thus, α is increased by increasing the series resistance or de-
creasing the parallel resistance. The key equations for parallel and series RLC
circuits are summarized in Table 9.1 for convenience.

                                                                                                                               EXAMPLE 9.7

 We find that α = R/2L = 1000 s−1 and ω0 = 1/ LC = 20,025 rad/s.                                                         i     C             +

         a pair of broken lines.

          The settling time can be determined easily here by using the upper
       portion of the envelope. That is, we set 2e−1000ts mA equal to 1 percent
       of its maximum value, 2 mA. Thus, e−1000ts = 0.01, and ts = 4.61 ms is
       the approximate value that is usually used.

    As a final example, we pause to consider situations where the circuit in-
cludes a dependent source. If no controlling current or voltage associated with
the dependent source is of interest, we may simply find the Thévenin equiva-
lent connected to the inductor and capacitor. Otherwise, we are likely faced
with having to write an appropriate integrodifferential equation, take the indi-
cated derivative, and solve the resulting differential equation as best we can.

 As we are interested only in vC(t), it is perfectly acceptable to begin by
 finding the Thévenin equivalent resistance connected in series with the
                                                                        (Continued on next page)

       inductor and capacitor at t = 0+ . We do this by connecting a 1 A source
       as shown in Fig. 9.25b, from which we deduce that
                               vtest = 11i − 3i = 8i = 8(1) = 8 V
                                                          √
       Thus, Req = 8 , so α = R/2L = 0.8 s−1 and ω0 = 1/ LC =
       10 rad/s, meaning that we expect an underdamped response with
       ωd = 9.968 rad/s and the form
                         vC (t) = e−0.8t (B1 cos 9.968t + B2 sin 9.968t)                             [32]

          In considering the circuit at t = 0− , we note that i L (0− ) = 0 due to
       the presence of the capacitor. By Ohm’s law, i(0− ) = 5 A, so

                      vC (0+ ) = vC (0− ) = 10 − 3i = 10 − 15 = −5 V

       This last condition substituted into Eq. [32] yields B1 = −5 V. Taking
       the derivative of Eq. [32] and evaluating at t = 0 yield
                         

                     dt t=0
       We see from Fig. 9.25a that
                                                            dvC
                                               i = −C
                                                             dt
       Thus, making use of the fact that i(0+ ) = i L (0− ) = 0 in Eq. [33] yields
       B2 = −0.4013 V, and we may write

          vC (t) = −e−0.8t (5 cos 9.968t + 0.4013 sin 9.968t)                          V        t >0

9.6 THE COMPLETE RESPONSE OF THE RLC CIRCUIT
      •
We now consider those RLC circuits in which dc sources are switched into the
network and produce forced responses that do not necessarily vanish as time
becomes infinite.
   The general solution is obtained by the same procedure that was fol-
lowed for RL and RC circuits. The basic steps are (not necessarily in this
order) as follows:
 1. Determine the initial conditions.
 2. Obtain a numerical value for the forced response.
 3. Write the appropriate form of the natural response with the necessary
    number of arbitrary constants.
 4. Add the forced response and natural response to form the complete
    response.
 5. Evaluate the response and its derivative at t = 0, and employ the ini-
    tial conditions to solve for the values of the unknown constants.
We note that it is generally this last step that causes the most trouble for stu-
dents, as the circuit must be carefully evaluated at t = 0 to make full use of
the initial conditions. Consequently, although the determination of the initial
conditions is basically no different for a circuit containing dc sources from
what it is for the source-free circuits that we have already covered in some de-
tail, this topic will receive particular emphasis in the examples that follow.
    Most of the confusion in determining and applying the initial conditions
arises for the simple reason that we do not have a rigorous set of rules laid
down for us to follow. At some point in each analysis, a situation usually
arises in which some thinking is involved that is more or less unique to that
particular problem. This is almost always the source of the difficulty.

The Easy Part
The complete response (arbitrarily assumed to be a voltage response) of a
second-order system consists of a forced response,
                                v f (t) = V f
352                  CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT


                     which is a constant for dc excitation, and a natural response,
                                                 vn (t) = Aes1 t + Bes2 t
                     Thus,
                                                       v(t) = V f + Aes1 t + Bes2 t
                         We assume that s1, s2, and Vf have already been determined from the cir-
                     cuit and the given forcing functions; A and B remain to be found. The last
                     equation shows the functional interdependence of A, B, v, and t; and substitu-
                     tion of the known value of v at t = 0+ thus provides us with a single equation
                     relating A and B, v(0+ ) = V f + A + B. This is the easy part.

                     The Other Part
                     Another relationship between A and B is necessary, unfortunately, and this is
                     normally obtained by taking the derivative of the response,
                                                dv
                                                    = 0 + s1 Aes1 t + s2 Bes2 t
                                                dt
                     and inserting the known value of dv/dt at t = 0+. We thus have two equa-
                     tions relating A and B, and these may be solved simultaneously to evaluate
                     the two constants.
                         The only remaining problem is that of determining the values of v and
                     dv/dt at t = 0+. Let us suppose that v is a capacitor voltage, vC. Since
                     i C = C dvC /dt, we should recognize the relationship between the initial
                     value of dv/dt and the initial value of some capacitor current. If we can es-
                     tablish a value for this initial capacitor current, then we will automatically es-
                     tablish the value of dv/dt. Students are usually able to get v(0+ ) very easily,
                     but are inclined to stumble a bit in finding the initial value of dv/dt. If we had
                     selected an inductor current iL as our response, then the initial value of di L /dt
                     would be intimately related to the initial value of some inductor voltage. Vari-
                     ables other than capacitor voltages and inductor currents are determined by
                     expressing their initial values and the initial values of their derivatives in
                     terms of the corresponding values for vC and iL.
                         We will illustrate the procedure and find all these values by the careful
                     analysis of the circuit shown in Fig. 9.28. To simplify the analysis, an unusual
                     value of capacitance is used again.

                                                                                       EXAMPLE 9.9
There are three passive elements in the circuit shown in Fig. 9.28a,
and a voltage and a current are defined for each. Find the values of
these six quantities at both t  0− and t  0+.

Our object is to find the value of each current and voltage at both
t = 0− and t = 0+ . Once these quantities are known, the initial values
of the derivatives may be found easily.
1. t = 0− At t = 0− , only the right-hand current source is active as
depicted in Fig. 9.28b. The circuit is assumed to have been in this state
forever, so all currents and voltages are constant. Thus, a dc current
through the inductor requires zero voltage across it:
                                  v L (0− ) = 0
and a dc voltage across the capacitor (−v R ) requires zero current
through it:
                                  i C (0− ) = 0
We next apply Kirchhoff’s current law to the right-hand node to obtain
                                i R (0− ) = −5 A
which also yields
                           v R (0− ) = −150 V
We may now use Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the left-hand mesh,
finding
                            vC (0− ) = 150 V
while KCL enables us to find the inductor current,
                                 i L (0− ) = 5 A

2. t = 0+ During the interval from t = 0− to t = 0+ , the left-hand
current source becomes active and many of the voltage and current
values at t = 0− will change abruptly. The corresponding circuit is
shown in Fig. 9.28c. However, we should begin by focusing our
attention on those quantities which cannot change, namely, the
inductor current and the capacitor voltage. Both of these must remain
constant during the switching interval. Thus,
              i L (0+ ) = 5 A       and       vC (0+ ) = 150 V
Since two currents are now known at the left node, we next obtain
            i R (0+ ) = −1 A         and          v R (0+ ) = −30 V
so that
              i C (0+ ) = 4 A       and       v L (0+ ) = 120 V
and we have our six initial values at t = 0− and six more at t = 0+ .
Among these last six values, only the capacitor voltage and the inductor
current are unchanged from the t = 0− values.
354   CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT


          We could have employed a slightly different method to evaluate these
      currents and voltages at t = 0− and t = 0+ . Prior to the switching
      operation, only direct currents and voltages exist in the circuit. The inductor
      may therefore be replaced by a short circuit, its dc equivalent, while the
      capacitor is replaced by an open circuit. Redrawn in this manner, the cir-
      cuit of Fig. 9.28a appears as shown in Fig. 9.29a. Only the current source
      at the right is active, and its 5 A flow through the resistor and the inductor.
      We therefore have i R (0− ) = −5 A and v R (0− ) = −150 V, i L (0− ) = 5 A
      and v L (0− ) = 0, and i C (0− ) = 0 and vC (0− ) = 150 V, as before.

        circuit with labeled voltages and currents valid at the instant defined by t = 0+.



          We now turn to the problem of drawing an equivalent circuit that will
      assist us in determining the several voltages and currents at t = 0+ . Each
      capacitor voltage and each inductor current must remain constant during
      the switching interval. These conditions are ensured by replacing the induc-
      tor with a current source and the capacitor with a voltage source. Each
      source serves to maintain a constant response during the discontinuity. The
      equivalent circuit of Fig. 9.29b results. It should be noted that the circuit
      shown in Fig. 9.29b is valid only for the interval between 0− and 0+ .
          The voltages and currents at t = 0+ are obtained by analyzing this dc
      circuit. The solution is not difficult, but the relatively large number of
      sources present in the network does produce a somewhat strange sight.
      However, problems of this type were solved in Chap. 3, and nothing new is
      involved. Attacking the currents first, we begin at the upper left node and
      see that i R (0+ ) = 4 − 5 = −1 A. Moving to the upper right node, we find
      that i C (0+ ) = −1 + 5 = 4 A. And, of course, i L (0+ ) = 5 A.
          Next we consider the voltages. Using Ohm’s law, we see that v R (0+ ) =
      30(−1) = −30 V. For the inductor, KVL gives us v L (0+ ) = −30 + 150 =
      120 V. Finally, including vC (0+ ) = 150 V, we have all the values at t = 0+ .

       and KVL are both satisfied by the derivatives also. For example, at the

          Before leaving this problem of the determination of the necessary initial
      values, we should point out that at least one other powerful method of deter-
      mining them has been omitted: we could have written general nodal or loop
      equations for the original circuit. Then the substitution of the known zero
      values of inductor voltage and capacitor current at t = 0− would uncover
      several other response values at t = 0− and enable the remainder to be found
      easily. A similar analysis at t = 0+ must then be made. This is an important
      method, and it becomes a necessary one in more complicated circuits which
      cannot be analyzed by our simpler step-by-step procedures.
          Now let us briefly complete the determination of the response vC (t) for
      the original circuit of Fig. 9.31. With both sources dead, the circuit appears as
      a series RLC circuit and s1 and s2 are easily found to be −1 and −9, respec-
      tively. The forced response may be found by inspection or, if necessary, by
      drawing the dc equivalent, which is similar to Fig. 9.29a, with the addition of
      a 4 A current source. The forced response is 150 V. Thus,
                                  vC (t) = 150 + Ae−t + Be−9t
      and
                                  vC (0+ ) = 150 = 150 + A + B
      or
                                           A+B =0
      Then,
                                    dvC
                                        = −Ae−t − 9Be−9t

A Quick Summary of the Solution Process
In summary, then, whenever we wish to determine the transient behavior of a
simple three-element RLC circuit, we must first decide whether we are con-
fronted with a series or a parallel circuit, so that we may use the correct rela-
tionship for α. The two equations are
                               1
                       α=                (parallel R LC)
                             2RC
                              R
                       α=                 (series R LC)
                             2L
Our second decision is made after comparing α with ω0, which is given for
either circuit by
                                         1
                                 ω0 = √
                                         LC
If α > ω0, the circuit is overdamped, and the natural response has the form
                            f n (t) = A1 es1 t + A2 es2 t
where
                                            
                           s1,2 = −α ±       α 2 − ω02
If α = ω0, then the circuit is critically damped and
                           f n (t) = e−αt(A1 t + A2 )
And finally, if α < ω0, then we are faced with the underdamped response,
                   f n (t) = e−αt (A1 cos ωd t + A2 sin ωd t)
where
                                       
                                ωd =    ω02 − α 2

Our last decision depends on the independent sources. If there are none
acting in the circuit after the switching or discontinuity is completed, then the
circuit is source-free and the natural response accounts for the complete re-
sponse. If independent sources are still present, then the circuit is driven and
a forced response must be determined. The complete response is then the sum
                             f (t) = f f (t) + f n (t)
This is applicable to any current or voltage in the circuit. Our final step is to
solve for unknown constants given the initial conditions.

When we considered the source-free RLC circuit, it became apparent that the
resistor served to dissipate any initial energy stored in the circuit. At some
point it might occur to us to ask what would happen if we could remove the
resistor. If the value of the resistance in a parallel RLC circuit becomes infinite,
or zero in the case of a series RLC circuit, we have a simple LC loop in which
an oscillatory response can be maintained forever. Let us look briefly at an ex-
ample of such a circuit, and then discuss another means of obtaining an iden-
tical response without the need of supplying any inductance.

     Since v(0) = 0, we see that A = 0. Next,                                              and i(0) = − 16 A.

But i(0) = − 16 ampere, and therefore dv/dt = 6 V/s at t = 0. We must have
B = 2 V and so
                               v = 2 sin 3t       V
which is an undamped sinusoidal response; in other words, our voltage
response does not decay.
    Now let us see how we might obtain this voltage without using an LC cir-
cuit. Our intentions are to write the differential equation that v satisfies and
then to develop a configuration of op amps that will yield the solution of the
equation. Although we are working with a specific example, the technique is
a general one that can be used to solve any linear homogeneous differential
equation.
    For the LC circuit of Fig. 9.34, we select v as our variable and set the sum
of the downward inductor and capacitor currents equal to zero:

                                                        In order to solve this equation, we plan to make use of the operational amplifier
                                                        as an integrator. We assume that the highest-order derivative appearing in the
                                                        differential equation here, d 2 v/dt 2, is available in our configuration of op
                                                        amps at an arbitrary point A. We now make use of the integrator, with RC = 1,
                                                        as discussed in Sec. 7.5. The input is d 2 v/dt 2, and the output must be −dv/dt,
                                                        where the sign change results from using an inverting op amp configuration
                                                        for the integrator. The initial value of dv/dt is 6 V/s, as we showed when we
                                                        first analyzed the circuit, and thus an initial value of −6 V must be set in the in-
                                   Rf                   tegrator. The negative of the first derivative now forms the input to a second
                                                        integrator. Its output is therefore v(t), and the initial value is v(0) = 0. Now it
                  R1                                    only remains to multiply v by −9 to obtain the second derivative we assumed

the appropriate sinusoidal voltage between its output terminal and ground.
This can be a considerable practical or economic advantage in circuit design,
as inductors are typically bulky, more costly than capacitors, and have more
losses associated with them (and therefore are not as well approximated by

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
The simple RL and RC circuits examined in Chap. 8 essentially did one of
two things as the result of throwing a switch: charge or discharge. Which
one happened was determined by the initial charge state of the energy
storage element. In this chapter, we considered circuits that had two energy
storage elements (a capacitor and an inductor), and found that things could
get pretty interesting. There are two basic configurations of such RLC
circuits: parallel connected and series connected. Analysis of such a circuit
yields a second-order partial differential equation, consistent with the
number of distinct energy storage elements (if we construct a circuit using
only resistors and capacitors such that the capacitors cannot be combined
using series/parallel techniques, we also obtain—eventually—a second-
order partial differential equation).
    Depending on the value of the resistance connected to our energy
storage elements, we found the transient response of an RLC circuit could
be either overdamped (decaying exponentially) or underdamped (decaying,
but oscillatory), with a “special case” of critically damped which is difficult
to achieve in practice. Oscillations can be useful (for example, in
transmitting information over a wireless network) and not so useful (for
example, in accidental feedback situations between an amplifier and a
microphone at a concert). Although the oscillations are not sustained in the
circuits we examined, we have at least seen one way to create them at will,
362   CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT


      and design for a specific frequency of operation if so desired. We didn’t end
      up spending a great deal of time with the series connected RLC circuit
      because with the exception of α, the equations are the same; only a minor
      adjustment in how we employ initial conditions to find the two unknown
      constants characterizing the transient response is needed. Along those lines,
      there were two “tricks,” if you will, that we encountered. One is that to
      employ the second initial condition, we need to take the derivative of our
      response equation. The second is that whether we’re employing KCL or
      KVL to make use of that initial condition, we’re doing so at the instant that
      t = 0; appreciating this fact can simplify equations dramatically by setting
      t = 0 early.
          We wrapped up the chapter by considering the complete response, and
      our approach to this did not differ significantly from what we did in Chap. 8.
      We closed with a brief section on a topic that might have occurred to us at
      some point—what happens when we remove the resistive losses completely
      (by setting parallel resistance to ∞, or series resistance to 0)? We end up
      with an LC circuit, and we saw that we can approximate such an animal
      with an op amp circuit.
          By now the reader is likely ready to finish reviewing key concepts of the
      chapter, so we’ll stop here and list them, along with corresponding exam-
      ples in the text.
      ❑ Circuits that contain two energy storage devices that cannot be com-
          bined using series-parallel combination techniques are described by a
          second-order differential equation.
      ❑ Series and parallel RLC circuits fall into one of three categories, depend-
          ing on the relative values of R, L, and C:
                                  Overdamped           α > ω0
                                  Critically damped    α = ω0
                                  Underdamped          α < ω0
          (Example 9.1)
                                                       √
      ❑   For series RLC circuits, α = R/2L and ω0 = 1/ LC. (Example 9.7)
                                                          √
      ❑   For parallel RLC circuits, α = 1/2RC and ω0 = 1/ LC. (Example 9.1)
      ❑   The typical form of an overdamped response is the sum of two exponen-
          tial terms, one of which decays more quickly than the other: e.g.,
          A1 e−t + A2 e−6t . (Examples 9.2, 9.3, 9.4)
      ❑   The typical form of a critically damped response is e−αt (A1 t + A2 ).
          (Example 9.5)
      ❑   The typical form of an underdamped response is an exponentially
          damped sinusoid: e−αt (B1 cos ωd t + B2 sin ωd t).
          (Examples 9.6, 9.7, 9.8)
      ❑   During the transient response of an RLC circuit, energy is transferred
          between energy storage elements to the extent allowed by the resistive
          component of the circuit, which acts to dissipate the energy initially
          stored. (See Computer-Aided Analysis section.)
      ❑   The complete response is the sum of the forced and natural responses.
          In this case the total response must be determined before solving for the
          constants. (Examples 9.9, 9.10)

                                   The function repeats itself every 2π radians, and its period is therefore 2π

                                   includes a phase angle θ in its argument. Equation [1] is plotted in Fig. 10.2
                                   as a function of ωt, and the phase angle appears as the number of radians by

                                   to the left, or earlier in time. Since corresponding points on the sinusoid
                                   Vm sin(ωt + θ) occur θ rad, or θ/ω seconds, earlier, we say that

sin ωt as lagging sin(ωt + θ) by θ rad, as leading sin(ωt + θ) by −θ rad,
or as leading sin(ωt − θ) by θ rad.
    In either case, leading or lagging, we say that the sinusoids are out of
phase. If the phase angles are equal, the sinusoids are said to be in phase.
                                                                                       Recall that to convert radians to degrees, we simply
    In electrical engineering, the phase angle is commonly given in degrees,

rather than radians; to avoid confusion we should be sure to always use the
degree symbol. Thus, instead of writing

we customarily use
                       v = 100 sin(2π1000t − 30◦ )

In evaluating this expression at a specific instant of time, e.g., t = 10−4 s,
2π 1000t becomes 0.2π radian, and this should be expressed as 36° before
30° is subtracted from it. Don’t confuse your apples with your oranges.

  Two sinusoidal waves whose phases are to be compared must:
  1. Both be written as sine waves, or both as cosine waves.
  2. Both be written with positive amplitudes.
  3. Each have the same frequency.

                                                              • FUNCTIONS
                                                       Now that we are familiar with the mathematical characteristics of sinusoids,
                                                       we are ready to apply a sinusoidal forcing function to a simple circuit and
                                                       obtain the forced response. We will first write the differential equation that
                                                       applies to the given circuit. The complete solution of this equation is com-
                                                       posed of two parts, the complementary solution (which we call the natural
                                                       response) and the particular integral (or forced response). The methods we
                                                       plan to develop in this chapter assume that we are not interested in the short-
                                                       lived transient or natural response of our circuit, but only in the long-term
                                                       or “steady-state” response.

                                                       The Steady-State Response
                                                       The term steady-state response is used synonymously with forced response,
                                                       and the circuits we are about to analyze are commonly said to be in the
                                                       “sinusoidal steady state.” Unfortunately, steady state carries the connota-
                                                       tion of “not changing with time” in the minds of many students. This is true
                                                       for dc forcing functions, but the sinusoidal steady-state response is defi-
                                                       nitely changing with time. The steady state simply refers to the condition
                                                       that is reached after the transient or natural response has died out.
                                                           The forced response has the mathematical form of the forcing function,
                                                       plus all its derivatives and its first integral. With this knowledge, one of the

                                                       composed of a sum of such functions, where each function has an unknown

                                                                                        dt

                                                       obtained by applying KVL around the simple loop. At any instant where the
                                                       derivative is equal to zero, we see that the current must have the form
                                                       i ∝ cos ωt . Similarly, at an instant where the current is equal to zero, the
                             SECTION 10.2 FORCED RESPONSE TO SINUSOIDAL FUNCTIONS                                                          375

derivative must be proportional to cos ωt, implying a current of the form
sin ωt . We might expect, therefore, that the forced response will have the
general form
                         i(t) = I1 cos ωt + I2 sin ωt
where I1 and I2 are real constants whose values depend upon Vm, R, L, and ω.
No constant or exponential function can be present. Substituting the assumed
form for the solution in the differential equation yields
  L(−I1 ω sin ωt + I2 ω cos ωt) + R(I1 cos ωt + I2 sin ωt) = Vm cos ωt
If we collect the cosine and sine terms, we obtain
         (−L I1 ω + R I2 ) sin ωt + (L I2 ω + R I1 − Vm ) cos ωt = 0
   This equation must be true for all values of t, which can be achieved
only if the factors multiplying cos ωt and sin ωt are each zero. Thus,
         −ωL I1 + R I2 = 0         and       ωL I2 + R I1 − Vm = 0
and simultaneous solution for I1 and I2 leads to
                            RVm                     ωL Vm
                  I1 =                     I2 =
                         R + ω2 L 2
                          2                       R + ω2 L 2
                                                   2

Thus, the forced response is obtained:
                          RVm              ωL Vm
              i(t) =             cos ωt + 2         sin ωt                   [2]

A More Compact and User-Friendly Form
Although accurate, this expression is slightly cumbersome; a clearer picture
of the response can be obtained by expressing it as a single sinusoid or
cosinusoid with a phase angle. We choose to express the response as a cosine
function,
                            i(t) = A cos(ωt − θ)                             [3]
    At least two methods of obtaining the values of A and θ suggest them-

Selecting the latter method, and expanding the function cos(ωt − θ):
                                          RVm                ωL Vm
A cos θ cos ωt + A sin θ sin ωt =                  cos ωt + 2         sin ωt
                                      R 2 + ω2 L 2         R + ω2 L 2
All that remains is to collect terms and perform a bit of algebra, an exercise
left to the reader. The result is
                                            ωL
                                  θ = tan−1
                                             R
and
                                          Vm
                               A= √
                                       R + ω2 L 2
                                        2

and so the alternative form of the forced response therefore becomes

Since there are no dependent sources in sight, we find Rth by shorting
out the independent source and calculating the resistance of the passive
network, so Rth = (25 × 100)/(25 + 100) = 20 .
   Now we do have a series RL circuit, with L = 30 mH, Rth = 20 ,
and a source voltage of 8 cos 103 t V, as shown in Fig. 10.5c. Thus,
applying Eq. [4], which was derived for a general RL series circuit,

                                                            straightforward manner. However, it isn’t particularly graceful, and after
                                                            being applied to a few circuits, it remains as clunky and cumbersome as the
                                                            first time we use it. The real problem isn’t the time-varying source—it’s the
                                                            inductor (or capacitor), since a purely resistive circuit is no more difficult to

                                                            equations result. It turns out that if the transient response is of no interest to
                                                            us, there is an alternative approach for obtaining the sinusoidal steady-state

                                                            that it allows us to relate the current and voltage associated with any element
                                                            using a simple algebraic expression.
  Appendix 5 defines the complex number and related
                                                                The basic idea is that sinusoids and exponentials are related through
  terms, reviews complex arithmetic, and develops Euler’s
                                                            complex numbers. Euler’s identity, for example, tells us that
  identity and the relationship between exponential and
  polar forms.                                                                                 e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ
                                                            Whereas taking the derivative of a cosine function yields a (negative) sine
                                                            function, the derivative of an exponential is simply a scaled version of the
                                                            same exponential. If at this point the reader is thinking, “All this is great, but
                                                            there are no imaginary numbers in any circuit I ever plan to build!” that may
                                                            be true. What we’re about to see, however, is that adding imaginary sources

                                                            reflection should remind us that superposition requires any imaginary sources
                                                            we might add to cause only imaginary responses, and real sources can only
                                                            lead to real responses. Thus, at any point, we should be able to separate the
                                                            two by simply taking the real part of any complex voltage or current.

    Now let us change our time reference by shifting the phase of the forc-
ing function by 90°, or changing the instant that we call t = 0. Thus, the
forcing function
                       Vm cos(ωt + θ − 90◦ ) = Vm sin(ωt + θ)                        [7]

when applied to the same network will produce a corresponding response
                       Im cos(ωt + φ − 90◦ ) = Im sin(ωt + φ)                        [8]

We next depart from physical reality by applying an imaginary forcing
function, one that cannot be applied in the laboratory but can be applied
mathematically.


Imaginary Sources Lead to . . . Imaginary Responses
We construct an imaginary source very simply; it is only necessary to mul-                  Electrical engineers use “j ” instead of “i” to represent
tiply Eq. [7] by j, the imaginary operator. We thus apply                                   √
                                                                                               −1 to avoid confusion with currents.
                                      jVm sin(ωt + θ)                                [9]

What is the response? If we had doubled the source, then the principle of
linearity would require that we double the response; multiplication of the
forcing function by a constant k would result in the multiplication
                                                              √       of the
response by the same constant k. The fact that our constant is −1 does not
destroy this relationship. The response to the imaginary source of Eq. [9] is
thus
                                      jIm sin(ωt + φ)                               [10]

The imaginary source and response are indicated in Fig. 10.9.

Applying a Complex Forcing Function
We have applied a real source and obtained a real response; we have also
applied an imaginary source and obtained an imaginary response. Since we
are dealing with a linear circuit, we may use the superposition theorem to
find the response to a complex forcing function which is the sum of the real
and imaginary forcing functions. Thus, the sum of the forcing functions of
Eqs. [5] and [9],
                         Vm cos(ωt + θ) + jVm sin(ωt + θ)                           [11]

must produce a response that is the sum of Eqs. [6] and [10],
                          Im cos(ωt + φ) + jIm sin(ωt + φ)                          [12]

                                                            The complex source and response may be represented more simply by ap-

                                                            to obtain the desired real response, we will substitute a complex forcing

take the indicated derivative:
                   R Im e j (ωt+φ) + jωL Im e j (ωt+φ) = Vm e jωt

and obtain an algebraic equation. In order to determine the values of Im and
φ, we divide throughout by the common factor e jωt :
                           R Im e jφ + jωL Im e jφ = Vm

factor the left side:
                             Im e jφ (R + jωL) = Vm

rearrange:

and identify Im and φ by expressing the right side of the equation in expo-

The complex response is given by Eq. [15]. Since Im and φ are readily iden-
tified, we can write the expression for i(t) immediately. However, if we feel
like using a more rigorous approach, we may obtain the real response i(t)
by reinserting the e jωt factor on both sides of Eq. [15] and taking the real
part. Either way, we find that

10.4          THE PHASOR
          •
In the last section, we saw that the addition of an imaginary sinusoidal source
led to algebraic equations which describe the sinusoidal steady-state re-
sponse of a circuit. An intermediate step of our analysis was the “canceling”
of the complex exponential term—once its derivative was taken, we appar-
ently had no further use for it until the real form of the response was desired.
Even then, it was possible to read the magnitude and phase angle directly
from our analysis, and hence skip the step where we overtly take the real
part. Another way of looking at this is that every voltage and current in our
circuit contain the same factor e jωt , and the frequency, although relevant to
our analysis, does not change as we move through the circuit. Dragging it
around, then, is a bit of a waste of time.
    Looking back at Example 10.2, then, we could represent our source as
                                       ◦
                                 3e j0 V           (or even just 3 V)                                          e j 0 = cos 0 + j sin 0 = 1
                                                      jφ
and our capacitor voltage as Vm e , which we ultimately found was
               ◦
0.02985e− j84.3 V. Knowledge of the source frequency is implicit here;
without it, we are unable to reconstruct any voltage or current.
    These complex quantities are usually written in polar form rather than
exponential form in order to achieve a slight additional saving of time and                                    Remember that none of the steady-state circuits we are
effort. For example, a source voltage                                                                          considering will respond at a frequency other than that
                            v(t) = Vm cos ωt = Vm cos(ωt + 0◦ )                                                of the excitation source, so that the value of ω is always
                                                                                                               known.
we now represent in complex form as
                                                  Vm /0◦
and its current response
                                      i(t) = Im cos(ωt + φ)
becomes
                                                     
                                                   Im φ
This abbreviated complex representation is called a phasor.1
    Let us review the steps by which a real sinusoidal voltage or current is
transformed into a phasor, and then we will be able to define a phasor more
meaningfully and to assign a symbol to represent it.
A real sinusoidal current
                          i(t) = Im cos(ωt + φ)
is expressed as the real part of a complex quantity by invoking Euler’s
identity
                                                
                         i(t) = Re Im e j (ωt+φ)
We then represent the current as a complex quantity by dropping the in-
struction Re{}, thus adding an imaginary component to the current without
affecting the real component; further simplification is achieved by sup-
pressing the factor e jωt :
                                I = Im e jφ
and writing the result in polar form:
                                        
                                  I = Im φ

                                                          because the phasor is not an instantaneous function of time; it contains
                 i(t) = Re{Im e j(␻t + )}                only amplitude and phase information. We recognize this difference in view-

                                                          frequency-domain expression of a current or voltage does not explicitly in-

                                                          frequency domain is exactly the reverse of the previous sequence. Thus,

    The real power of the phasor-based analysis technique lies in the fact
that it is possible to define algebraic relationships between the voltage and
current for inductors and capacitors, just as we have always been able to do
in the case of resistors. Now that we are able to transform into and out of the
frequency domain, we can proceed to our simplification of sinusoidal
steady-state analysis by establishing the relationship between the phasor
voltage and phasor current for each of the three passive elements.


The Resistor
The resistor provides the simplest case. In the time domain, as indicated by                     i                       I

                                                                                             v = Ri            R     V = RI             R
Now let us apply the complex voltage

    As an example of the use of both the time-domain and frequency-

The Capacitor
The final element to consider is the capacitor. The time-domain current-
voltage relationship is
                                      dv(t)
                            i(t) = C
                                       dt
The equivalent expression in the frequency domain is obtained once more
by letting v(t) and i(t) be the complex quantities of Eqs. [16] and [17], tak-
ing the indicated derivative, suppressing e jωt , and recognizing the phasors V
and I. Doing this, we find                                                                                     dv
                                                                                                        i=C                     I = j␻CV
                                  I = jωCV                                 [21]                                dt
                                                                                                    +                       +
Thus, I leads V by 90° in a capacitor. This, of course, does not mean that a
current response is present one-quarter of a period earlier than the voltage                        v               C       V              C

current maximum is caused by the increasing voltage that occurs 90° earlier
than the voltage maximum.                                                                                (a)                      (b)

fact, we will indeed use them as we use Ohm’s law.

Kirchhoff’s Laws Using Phasors
Kirchhoff’s voltage law in the time domain is
                      v1 (t) + v2 (t) + · · · + v N (t) = 0
We now use Euler’s identity to replace each real voltage vi by a complex
voltage having the same real part, suppress e jωt throughout, and obtain
                         V1 + V2 + · · · + V N = 0
Thus, we see that Kirchhoff’s voltage law applies to phasor voltages just as
it did in the time domain. Kirchhoff’s current law can be shown to hold for
phasor currents by a similar argument.

10.5       IMPEDANCE AND ADMITTANCE
       •
The current-voltage relationships for the three passive elements in the fre-
quency domain are (assuming that the passive sign convention is satisfied)

                                                      jωC
If these equations are written as phasor voltage/phasor current ratios
                  V            V               V    1

                  I            I               I   jωC
we find that these ratios are simple quantities that depend on element values
(and frequency also, in the case of inductance and capacitance). We treat
these ratios in the same manner that we treat resistances, provided we
remember that they are complex quantities.
    Let us define the ratio of the phasor voltage to the phasor current as
impedance, symbolized by the letter Z. The impedance is a complex quan-
tity having the dimensions of ohms. Impedance is not a phasor and cannot
be transformed to the time domain by multiplying by e jωt and taking the real
part. Instead, we think of an inductor as being represented in the time
domain by its inductance L and in the frequency domain by its impedance           ZR = R
 jωL. A capacitor in the time domain has a capacitance C; in the frequency        Z L = j ωL
domain, it has an impedance 1/jωC . Impedance is a part of the frequency                   1
                                                                                  ZC =
domain and not a concept that is a part of the time domain.                              j ωC


Series Impedance Combinations
The validity of Kirchhoff’s two laws in the frequency domain leads to the fact
that impedances may be combined in series and parallel by the same rules we
established for resistances. For example, at ω = 10 × 103 rad/s, a 5 mH
inductor in series with a 100 μF capacitor may be replaced by the sum of the
individual impedances. The impedance of the inductor is
                           Z L = jωL = j50 

and the impedance of the capacitor is
                               1    −j                                            Note that 1  −j.
                       ZC =       =    = − j1                                              j
                              jωC   ωC
The impedance of the series combination is therefore
                  Zeq = Z L + ZC = j50 − j1 = j49 

    The impedance of inductors and capacitors is a function of frequency,
and this equivalent impedance is thus applicable only at the single frequency
at which it was calculated, ω = 10,000 rad/s. If we change the frequency to
ω = 5000 rad/s, for example, Zeq = j23 .

Parallel Impedance Combinations
The parallel combination of the 5 mH inductor and the 100 μF capacitor at
ω = 10,000 rad/s is calculated in exactly the same fashion in which we
390              CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS


                 calculated parallel resistances:
                                            ( j50)(− j1)   50
                                    Zeq =                =     = − j1.020 
                                              j50 − j1     j49

                 At ω = 5000 rad/s, the parallel equivalent is − j2.17 .


                 Reactance
                 Of course, we may choose to express impedance in either rectangular
                 (Z = R + jX) or polar (Z = |Z|/θ ) form. In rectangular form, we can see
                 clearly the real part which arises only from real resistances, and an imagi-
                 nary component, termed the reactance, which arises from the energy
                 storage elements. Both resistance and reactance have units of ohms, but
                 reactance will always depend upon frequency. An ideal resistor has zero
                 reactance; an ideal inductor or capacitor is purely reactive (i.e., character-
                 ized by zero resistance). Can a series or parallel combination include both
                 a capacitor and an inductor, and yet have zero reactance? Sure! Consider
                 the series connection of a 1  resistor, a 1 F capacitor, and a 1 H inductor
                 driven at ω = 1 rad/s. Zeq = 1 − j (1)(1) + j (1)(1) = 1 . At that partic-
                 ular frequency, the equivalent is a simple 1  resistor. However, even small
                 deviations from ω = 1 rad/s lead to nonzero reactance.

                  We begin by converting the resistors, capacitors, and inductor into the
                  corresponding impedances as shown in Fig. 10.18b.

    Upon examining the resulting network, we observe that the 6  im-
 pedance is in parallel with − j0.4 . This combination is equivalent to

                    (6)(− j0.4)

                     6 − j0.4

 which is in series with both the − j  and j10  impedances, so that
 we have

           0.0265 − j0.3982 − j + j10 = 0.02655 + j8.602 

   This new impedance is in parallel with 10 , so that the equivalent
 impedance of the network is

                                            10(0.02655 + j8.602)

                                         = 4.255 + j4.929 

    It is important to note that the resistive component of the impedance is not
necessarily equal to the resistance of the resistor that is present in the net-
work. For example, a 10  resistor and a 5 H inductor in series at ω = 4 rad/s
have an equivalent impedance Z = 10 + j20 , or, in polar form,
22.4/63.4◦ . In this case, the resistive component of the impedance is equal
to the resistance of the series resistor because the network is a simple series
network. However, if these same two elements are placed in parallel, the
equivalent impedance is 10( j20)/(10 + j20) , or 8 + j4 . The resistive
component of the impedance is now 8 .

                                 desired. (b) The frequency-domain equivalent of the given circuit at ω  3000 rad/s.




                 䉴 Identify the goal of the problem.
                    We need to find the sinusoidal steady-state current flowing through the
                    1.5 k resistor due to the 3000 rad/s voltage source.

                 䉴 Collect the known information.
                    We begin by drawing a frequency-domain circuit. The source is trans-
                    formed to the frequency-domain representation 40/−90◦ V, the fre-
                    quency domain response is represented as I, and the impedances of
                    the inductor and capacitor, determined at ω = 3000 rad/s, are j k and
                    − j2 k, respectively. The corresponding frequency-domain circuit is
                    shown in Fig. 10.20b.

                 䉴 Devise a plan.
                    We will analyze the circuit of Fig. 10.20b to obtain I; combining im-
                    pedances and invoking Ohm’s law is one possible approach. We will
                    then make use of the fact that we know ω = 3000 rad/s to convert I
                    into a time-domain expression.

                 䉴 Construct an appropriate set of equations.
                                                      ( j)(1 − 2 j)         2+ j

                                         = 1.5 +                = 1.5 +

   The phasor current is then simply

                                         Zeq

䉴 Determine if additional information is required.
   Substituting known values, we find that
                                    40/−90◦
                              I=              mA
                                   2.5/36.87◦

   which, along with the knowledge that ω = 3000 rad/s, is sufficient to
   solve for i(t).

䉴 Attempt a solution.
   This complex expression is easily simplified to a single complex
   number in polar form:
                 40
            I=       /−90◦ − 36.87◦ mA = 16.00/−126.9◦ mA
                 2.5

   Upon transforming the current to the time domain, the desired
   response is obtained:
                     i(t) = 16 cos(3000t − 126.9◦ )         mA

䉴 Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
   The effective impedance connected to the source has an angle of
   +36.87°, indicating that it has a net inductive character, or that the
   current will lag the voltage. Since the voltage source has a phase
   angle of −90◦ (once converted to a cosine source), we see that our                                 I1
   answer is consistent.

    Before we begin to write great numbers of equations in the time domain
or in the frequency domain, it is very important that we shun the construc-
tion of equations that are partly in the time domain, partly in the frequency
domain, and wholly incorrect. One clue that a faux pas of this type has been
committed is the sight of both a complex number and a t in the same equa-
tion, except in the factor e jωt . And, since e jωt plays a much bigger role in
derivations than in applications, it is pretty safe to say that students who find
they have just created an equation containing j and t, or / and t, have cre-
ated a monster that the world would be better off without.

                                                          based on our experience with resistors, the reciprocal is often just as valu-
                                                          able. We define this quantity as the admittance Y of a circuit element or

                                                                 •
                                                          We previously achieved a great deal with nodal and mesh analysis techniques,
                                                          and it’s reasonable to ask if a similar procedure might be valid in terms of pha-
                                                          sors and impedances for the sinusoidal steady state. We already know that
                                                          both of Kirchhoff’s laws are valid for phasors; also, we have an Ohm-like law
                                                          for the passive elements V = ZI. We may therefore analyze circuits by nodal
                                                          techniques in the sinusoidal steady state. Using similar arguments, we can
                                                          establish that mesh analysis methods are valid (and often useful) as well.

Two current sources are given as phasors, and phasor node voltages V1
and V2 are indicated. At the left node we apply KCL, yielding:

Combining terms, we have
                          (0.2 + j0.2)V1 − j0.1V2 = 1

and
                       − j0.1V1 + (0.1 − j0.1)V2 = j0.5

These equations are easily solved on most scientific calculators, result-
ing in V1 = 1 − j2 V and V2 = −2 + j4 V.
   The time-domain solutions are obtained by expressing V1 and V2 in
polar form:

                                  V1 = 2.24/−63.4◦
                                  V2 = 4.47/116.6◦

and passing to the time domain:

                     v1 (t) = 2.24 cos(ωt − 63.4◦ )                V
                     v2 (t) = 4.47 cos(ωt + 116.6◦ )                V

Note that the value of ω would have to be known in order to compute
the impedance values given on the circuit diagram. Also, both sources
must be operating at the same frequency.

                     Now let us look at an example of mesh analysis, keeping in mind again
                 that all sources must be operating at the same frequency. Otherwise, it is im-
                 possible to define a numerical value for any reactance in the circuit. As we
                 see in the next section, the only way out of such a dilemma is to apply
                 superposition.

10.7      SUPERPOSITION, SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS,
       • AND THÉVENIN’S THEOREM
After inductors and capacitors were introduced in Chap. 7, we found that
circuits containing these elements were still linear, and that the benefits of
linearity were again available. Included among these were the superposition
principle, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems, and source transformations.
Thus, we know that these methods may be used on the circuits we are now
considering; the fact that we happen to be applying sinusoidal sources and
are seeking only the forced response is immaterial. The fact that we are an-
alyzing the circuits in terms of phasors is also immaterial; they are still lin-
ear circuits. We might also remember that linearity and superposition were
invoked when we combined real and imaginary sources to obtain a complex
source.

instances, we simply employ superposition to determine the voltages and
currents due to each source, and then add the results in the time domain. If
several sources are operating at the same frequency, superposition will also
allow us to consider those sources at the same time, and add the resulting
response to the response(s) of any other source(s) operating at a different
frequency.

                                                                 (b)
                    ■ FIGURE 10.29 (a) Circuit of Fig. 10.22 for which V1 is desired, (b) V1 may be found by using
                      superposition of the separate phasor responses.

                   First we redraw the circuit as Fig. 10.29b, where each pair of parallel
                   impedances is replaced by a single equivalent impedance. That is,
                   5 − j10  is 4 − j2 ; j10 − j5  is − j10 ; and 10  j5 is equal
                   to 2 + j4 . To find V1, we first activate only the left source and find
                   the partial response, V1L. The 1/0◦ source is in parallel with an
                   impedance of
                                                  (4 − j2)  (− j10 + 2 + j4)

                   so that
                                                             (4 − j2)(− j10 + 2 + j4)
                                         V1L = 1/0◦
                                                              4 − j2 − j10 + 2 + j4
                                                    −4 − j28
                                               =             = 2 − j2 V
                                                     6 − j8
                   With only the right source active, current division and Ohm’s law yield
                                                                    

                                            4 − j2 − j10 + 2 + j4

                   Summing, then,
                                  V1 = V1L + V1R = 2 − j2 − 1 = 1 − j2                            V
                   which agrees with our previous result from Example 10.8.
                      As we will see, superposition is also extremely useful when dealing
                   with a circuit in which not all sources operate at the same frequency.

       The open-circuit voltage, defined in Fig. 10.31b, is
                       Voc = (1/0◦ )(4 − j2) − (−0.5/−90◦ )(2 + j4)
                            = 4 − j2 + 2 − j1 = 6 − j3        V
       The impedance of the inactive circuit of Fig. 10.31c as viewed from the
       load terminals is simply the sum of the two remaining impedances.
       Hence,
                                   Zth = 6 + j2 
       Thus, when we reconnect the circuit as in Fig. 10.31d, the current di-
       rected from node 1 toward node 2 through the − j 10  load is
                                    6 − j3
                          I12 =                 = 0.6 + j0.3 A
                                 6 + j2 − j10
           We now know the current flowing through the − j 10  impedance
       of Fig. 10.31a. Note that we are unable to compute V1 using the circuit
       of Fig. 10.31d as the reference node no longer exists. Returning to the
       original circuit, then, and subtracting the 0.6 + j0.3 A current from the
       left source current, the downward current through the (4 − j2) 
       branch is found:
                        I1 = 1 − 0.6 − j0.3 = 0.4 − j0.3        A
       and, thus,
                       V1 = (0.4 − j0.3)(4 − j2) = 1 − j2         V
       as before.
          We might have been clever and used Norton’s theorem on the three
       elements on the right of Fig. 10.31a, assuming that our chief interest is
       in V1. Source transformations can also be used repeatedly to simplify
       the circuit. Thus, all the shortcuts and tricks that arose in Chaps. 4 and
       5 are available for circuit analysis in the frequency domain. The slight
       additional complexity that is apparent now arises from the necessity of
       using complex numbers and not from any more involved theoretical
       considerations.

                             use of two specially designed sources: VAC and IAC. The magnitude
                             and phase of either source is selected by double-clicking on the part.

double-click on the IPRINT symbol in the schematic, and enter yes in
each of the appropriate fields.

                                                          might represent 100 V, while a phasor current 1 cm long could indicate 3 mA.

                                                          this point, we have been using the frequency-domain interpretation, as we

                                                          thus we now have the complex voltage Vm e jα e jωt = Vm /ωt + α. This

most easily by employing the single current as the reference phasor. Let us

stand out clearly. The sum of these three voltages is the source voltage, and

the “resonant condition’’ since ZC = −Z L , the source voltage and resistor
voltage are equal. The total voltage across the resistor and inductor or resis-

phasors as shown.                                                                                                                           VR + VC

    If the source current is specified initially as the convenient value of
1/0◦ A and the node voltage is not initially known, it is still convenient to
begin construction of the phasor diagram by assuming a node voltage (for
example, V = 1/0◦ V once again) and using it as the reference phasor. The
diagram is then completed as before, and the source current that flows as a
result of the assumed node voltage is again found to be 0.2 + j0.1 A. The
true source current is 1/0◦ A, however, and thus the true node voltage is
obtained by multiplying the assumed node voltage by 1/0◦ /(0.2 + j0.1);

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
This chapter dealt with the steady-state response of circuits to sinusoidal
excitation. This is a limited analysis of a circuit in some respects, as the
transient behavior is completely ignored. In many situations, such an
approach is more than adequate, and reducing the amount of information we
seek about a circuit speeds up the analysis considerably. The fundamental
idea behind what we did was that an imaginary source was added to every
real sinusoidal source; then Euler’s identity converted the source to a com-
plex exponential. Since the derivative of an exponential is simply another
exponential, what would otherwise be integrodifferential equations arising
from mesh or nodal analysis become algebraic equations.
    A few new terms were introduced: lagging, leading, impedance, ad-
mittance, and a particularly important one phasor. Phasor relationships
between current and voltage gave rise to the concept of impedance, where
resistors are represented by a real number (resistance, as before), and
inductors are represented by Z = jωL while capacitors are represented
by − j/ωC(ω being the operating frequency of our sources). From that
point forward, all the circuit analysis techniques learned in Chaps. 3 to
5 apply.
    It might seem odd to have an imaginary number as part of our solution,
but we found that recovering the time-domain solution to our analysis is
straightforward once the voltage or current is expressed in polar form. The
magnitude of our quantity of interest is the magnitude of the cosine func-
tion, the phase angle is the phase of the cosine term, and the frequency is
obtained from the original circuit (it disappears from view during the analy-
sis, but the circuits we are analyzing do not change it in any way). We con-
cluded the chapter with an introduction to the concept of phasor diagrams.
Prior to inexpensive scientific calculators such tools were invaluable in an-
alyzing many sinusoidal circuits. They still find use in analysis of ac power
systems, as we see in subsequent chapters.
    A concise list of key concepts of the chapter is presented below for
the convenience of the reader, along with the corresponding example
numbers.
❑ If two sine waves (or two cosine waves) both have positive magnitudes
    and the same frequency, it is possible to determine which waveform is
    leading and which is lagging by comparing their phase angles.
❑ The forced response of a linear circuit to a sinusoidal voltage or current
    source can always be written as a single sinusoid having the same
    frequency as the sinusoidal source. (Example 10.1)
❑ A phasor has both a magnitude and a phase angle; the frequency is
    understood to be that of the sinusoidal source driving the circuit.
    (Example 10.2)
❑ A phasor transform may be performed     on any sinusoidal function, and
    vice versa: Vm cos(ωt + φ) ↔ Vm φ. (Example 10.3)
❑ When transforming a time-domain circuit into the corresponding
    frequency-domain circuit, resistors, capacitors, and inductors are replaced
    by impedances (or, occasionally, by admittances). (Examples 10.4, 10.6)
    • The impedance of a resistor is simply its resistance.
410   CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS


          • The impedance of a capacitor is 1/jωC .
          • The impedance of an inductor is jωL .
      ❑   Impedances combine both in series and in parallel combinations in the
          same manner as resistors. (Example 10.6)
      ❑   All analysis techniques previously used on resistive circuits apply to
          circuits with capacitors and/or inductors once all elements are replaced
          by their frequency-domain equivalents. (Examples 10.5, 10.7, 10.8,
          10.9, 10.10, 10.11)
      ❑   Phasor analysis can only be performed on single-frequency circuits.
          Otherwise, superposition must be invoked, and the time-domain partial
          responses added to obtain the complete response. (Example 10.12)
      ❑   The power behind phasor diagrams is evident when a convenient forcing
          function is used initially, and the final result scaled appropriately.
          (Example 10.13)

 8. The concept of Fourier series is a powerful means of analyzing periodic
   waveforms in terms of sinusoids. For example, the triangle wave in Fig. 10.45
   can be represented by the infinite sum
                                                                         

    or 120 V. However, these values do not represent the peak ac voltage. Rather,
    they represent what is known as the root mean square of the voltage, defined as

          INTRODUCTION                                                             Power
          Often an integral part of circuit analysis is the determination of
          either power delivered or power absorbed (or both). In the context       Average Power Supplied by
          of ac power, we find that the rather simple approach we have taken       a Sinusoidal Source
          previously does not provide a convenient picture of how a particu-
          lar system is operating, so we introduce several different power-        Root-Mean-Square (RMS)
          related quantities in this chapter.                                      Values
              We begin by considering instantaneous power, the product of
          the time-domain voltage and time-domain current associated with          Reactive Power
          the element or network of interest. The instantaneous power
          is sometimes quite useful in its own right, because its maximum          The Relationship Between
          value might have to be limited to avoid exceeding the safe               Complex, Average, and
                                                                                   Reactive Power
          operating range of a physical device. For example, transistor and
          vacuum-tube power amplifiers both produce a distorted output,
                                                                                   Power Factor of a Load
          and speakers give a distorted sound, when the peak power exceeds
          a certain limiting value. However, we are mainly interested in
          instantaneous power for the simple reason that it provides us with
          the means to calculate a more important quantity, the average
          power. In a similar way, the progress of a cross-country road trip
          is best described by the average velocity; our interest in the instan-
          taneous velocity is limited to the avoidance of maximum velocities
          that will endanger our safety or arouse the highway patrol.
              In practical problems we will deal with values of average
          power which range from the small fraction of a picowatt available
          in a telemetry signal from outer space, to the few watts of audio
          power supplied to the speakers in a good stereo system, to the sev-
          eral hundred watts required to run the morning coffeepot, or to the
          10 billion watts generated at the Grand Coulee Dam. Still, we will

                                                  see that even the concept of average power has its limitations, especially
                                                  when dealing with the energy exchange between reactive loads and power
                                                  sources. This is easily handled by introducing the concepts of reactive
                                                  power, complex power, and the power factor—all very common terms in

In order to determine the power absorbed by the inductor, we first obtain the
inductor voltage:

since du(t)/dt is zero for t > 0 and (1 − e−Rt/L ) is zero at t = 0. The
power absorbed by the inductor is therefore

Power Due to Sinusoidal Excitation
Let us change the voltage source in the circuit of Fig. 11.1 to the sinusoidal
source Vm cos ωt . The familiar time-domain steady-state response is
                              i(t) = Im cos(ωt + φ)
where

                            Vm                                     ωL
             Im = √                         and       φ = −tan−1
                      R 2 + ω2 L 2                                  R

The instantaneous power delivered to the entire circuit in the sinusoidal
steady state is, therefore,
                 p(t) = v(t)i(t) = Vm Im cos(ωt + φ) cos ωt

which we will find convenient to rewrite in a form obtained by using the
trigonometric identity for the product of two cosine functions. Thus,
                            Vm Im
                 p(t) =           [cos(2ωt + φ) + cos φ]
                             2
                            Vm Im         Vm Im
                       =          cos φ +       cos(2ωt + φ)
                             2             2
    The last equation possesses several characteristics that are true in general
for circuits in the sinusoidal steady state. One term, the first, is not a function
of time; and a second term is included which has a cyclic variation at twice
the applied frequency. Since this term is a cosine wave, and since sine waves
and cosine waves have average values which are zero (when averaged over
an integral number of periods), this example suggests that the average
power is 12 Vm Im cos φ; as we will see shortly, this is indeed the case.

  EXAMPLE 11.1
                  A voltage source, 40 + 60u(t) V, a 5 μF capacitor, and a 200 
                  resistor form a series circuit. Find the power being absorbed by the
                  capacitor and by the resistor at t  1.2 ms.
                  At t = 0− , no current is flowing and so 40 V appears across the capaci-
                  tor. At t = 0+ , the voltage across the capacitor-resistor series combina-
                  tion jumps to 100 V. Since vC cannot change in zero time, the resistor
                  voltage at t = 0+ is 60 V.
                      The current flowing through all three elements at t = 0+ is therefore
                  60/200 = 300 mA and for t > 0 is given by
                                             i(t) = 300e−t/τ      mA
                  where τ = RC = 1 ms. Thus, the current flowing at t = 1.2 ms is
                  90.36 mA, and the power being absorbed by the resistor at that instant
                  is simply
                                                 i 2 (t)R = 1.633 W
                  The instantaneous power absorbed by the capacitor is i(t)vC (t). Recog-
                  nizing that the total voltage across both elements for t > 0 will always
                  be 100 V, and that the resistor voltage is given by 60e−t/τ ,
                                              vC (t) = 100 − 60e−t/τ
                  and we find that vC (1.2 ms) = 100 − 60e−1.2 = 81.93 V. Thus,
                  the power being absorbed by the capacitor at t = 1.2 ms is
                  (90.36 mA) (81.93 V) = 7.403 W.

                 11.2 AVERAGE POWER
                        •
                 When we speak of an average value for the instantaneous power, the time
                 interval over which the averaging process takes place must be clearly de-
                 fined. Let us first select a general interval of time from t1 to t2 . We may then
                 obtain the average value by integrating p(t) from t1 to t2 and dividing the
                 result by the time interval t2 − t1 . Thus,
                                                            t2

                                                   t2 − t1 t1
                 The average value is denoted by the capital letter P, since it is not a function
                 of time, and it usually appears without any specific subscripts that identify
                 it as an average value. Although P is not a function of time, it is a function

of t1 and t2 , the two instants of time which define the interval of integration.
This dependence of P on a specific time interval may be expressed in a
simpler manner if p(t) is a periodic function. We consider this important
case first.

riodic; a steady-state condition has been reached, although not necessarily
the sinusoidal steady state. We may define a periodic function f (t) mathe-
matically by requiring that
                               f (t) = f (t + T )                              [6]
where T is the period. We now show that the average value of the instanta-                                                               t

                                                                                        function p(t) is the same over any period T.
p(t). We first compute the average power by integrating from t1 to a time t2
which is one period later, t2 = t1 + T :
                                    
                                  1 t1 +T
                           P1 =           p(t) dt
                                  T t1
and then by integrating from some other time tx to tx + T :
                                 
                                1 tx +T
                           Px =          p(t) dt
                                T tx
    The equality of P1 and Px should be evident from the graphical interpre-
tation of the integrals; the periodic nature of the curve requires the two areas
to be equal. Thus, the average power may be computed by integrating the
instantaneous power over any interval that is one period in length and then
dividing by the period:
                                      
                                   1 tx +T
                              P=             p(t) dt                         [7]
                                   T tx
    It is important to note that we may also integrate over any integral number
of periods, provided that we divide by the same integral number of periods.
Thus,

                       nT tx
If we carry this concept to the extreme by integrating over all time, another
useful result is obtained. We first provide ourselves with symmetrical limits
on the integral
                                       nT /2

                                 nT −nT /2
and then take the limit as n becomes infinite,
                                       nT /2

                                   As long as p(t) is a mathematically well-behaved function, as all physi-
                               cal forcing functions and responses are, it is apparent that if a large integer
                               n is replaced by a slightly larger number which is not an integer, then the
                               value of the integral and of P is changed by a negligible amount; moreover,
                               the error decreases as n increases. Without justifying this step rigorously,
                               we therefore replace the discrete variable nT with the continuous variable τ :
                                                                      
                                                                    1 τ/2

                               We will find it convenient on several occasions to integrate periodic func-
                               tions over this “infinite period.”

                               Average Power in the Sinusoidal Steady State
                               Now let us obtain the general result for the sinusoidal steady state. We
                               assume the general sinusoidal voltage
                                                            v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + θ)
                               and current
                                                            i(t) = Im cos(ωt + φ)
                               associated with the device in question. The instantaneous power is
                                                   p(t) = Vm Im cos(ωt + θ) cos(ωt + φ)
                                  Again expressing the product of two cosine functions as one-half the
                               sum of the cosine of the difference angle and the cosine of the sum angle,
                                          p(t) = 12 Vm Im cos(θ − φ) + 12 Vm Im cos(2ωt + θ + φ)          [10]

                    1   2π     we may save ourselves some integration by an inspection of the result.
  Recall that T =     =    .   The first term is a constant, independent of t. The remaining term is a cosine
                    f    ω
                               function; p(t) is therefore periodic, and its period is 12 T . Note that the pe-
                               riod T is associated with the given current and voltage, and not with the
                               power; the power function has a period 12 T . However, we may integrate
                               over an interval of T to determine the average value if we wish; it is neces-
                               sary only that we also divide by T. Our familiarity with cosine and sine
                               waves, however, shows that the average value of either over a period is zero.
                               There is thus no need to integrate Eq. [10] formally; by inspection, the av-
                               erage value of the second term is zero over a period T (or 12 T ), and the av-
                               erage value of the first term, a constant, must be that constant itself. Thus,


                                                            P = 12 Vm Im cos(θ − φ)                       [11]


                               This important result, introduced in the previous section for a specific
                               circuit, is therefore quite general for the sinusoidal steady state. The average
                               power is one-half the product of the crest amplitude of the voltage, the crest
                               amplitude of the current, and the cosine of the phase-angle difference be-
                               tween the current and the voltage; the sense of the difference is immaterial.
                                   Two special cases are worth isolating for consideration: the average
                               power delivered to an ideal resistor and that to an ideal reactor (any combi-
                               nation of only capacitors and inductors).

                                                                                                     EXAMPLE 11.2
Given the time-domain voltage v  4 cos(πt/6) V, find both the
average power and an expression for the instantaneous power that
result when the corresponding phasor voltage V  4/0° V is applied
across an impedance Z  2/60° .
The phasor current is V/Z = 2/−60◦ A, and so the average power is
                                P = 12 (4)(2) cos 60◦ = 2 W
We can write the time-domain voltage,
                                                           πt
                                     v(t) = 4 cos                   V
                                                           6
and the time-domain current,
                                                               

                                        6
The instantaneous power, therefore, is given by their product:

All three quantities are sketched on the same time axis in Fig. 11.4.
Both the 2 W average value of the power and its period of 6 s, one-half
the period of either the current or the voltage, are evident. The zero
value of the instantaneous power at each instant when either the voltage
or current is zero is also apparent.

                                                          used. The most common error is made in trying to apply them in cases
                                                          where the voltage included in Eq. [13] is not the voltage across the resistor.

                                                          Also, do not forget the factor of 12 !

           ■ FIGURE 11.5 The average power delivered to each reactive element is
             zero in the sinusoidal steady state.
Without even analyzing the circuit, we already know that the average
power absorbed by the two reactive elements is zero.
   The values of I1 and I2 are found by any of several methods, such
as mesh analysis, nodal analysis, or superposition. They are
                  I1 = 5 − j10 = 11.18/−63.43◦ A
                  I2 = 5 − j5 = 7.071/−45◦ A
The downward current through the 2  resistor is
                              I1 − I2 = − j5 = 5/−90◦ A
so that Im = 5 A, and the average power absorbed by the resistor is
found most easily by Eq. [12]:
                            PR = 12 Im2 R = 12 (52 )2 = 25 W
This result may be checked by using Eq. [11] or Eq. [13]. We next turn
to the left source. The voltage 20/0◦ V and associated current I1 =
11.18/−63.43◦ A satisfy the active sign convention, and thus the power
delivered by this source is
              Pleft = 12 (20)(11.18) cos[0◦ − (−63.43◦ )] = 50 W
In a similar manner, we find the power absorbed by the right source
using the passive sign convention,
                 Pright = 12 (10)(7.071) cos(0◦ + 45◦ ) = 25 W
Since 50 = 25 + 25, the power relations check.

   In order to prove that maximum average power is indeed delivered to
the load when Z L = Z∗th , we must perform two separate steps. First, the
derivative of Eq. [14] with respect to RL must be set to zero. Second, the
derivative of Eq. [14] with respect to XL must be set to zero. The remaining
details are left as an exercise for the avid reader.

Average Power for Nonperiodic Functions
We should pay some attention to nonperiodic functions. One practical ex-
ample of a nonperiodic power function for which an average power value is
desired is the power output of a radio telescope directed toward a “radio
star.” Another is the sum of a number of periodic functions, each function
having a different period, such that no greater common period can be found
for the combination. For example, the current
                           i(t) = sin t + sin πt                         [15]
432              CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS


                 is nonperiodic because the ratio of the periods of the two sine waves is an
                 irrational number. At t = 0, both terms are zero and increasing. But the first
                 term is zero and increasing only when t = 2πn, where n is an integer, and
                 thus periodicity demands that πt or π(2πn) must equal 2πm, where m
                 is also an integer. No solution (integral values for both m and n) for this
                 equation is possible. It may be illuminating to compare the nonperiodic
                 expression in Eq. [15] with the periodic function
                                                    i(t) = sin t + sin 3.14t                                       [16]
                 where 3.14 is an exact decimal expression and is not to be interpreted as
                 3.141592. . . . With a little effort,2 it can be shown that the period of this cur-
                 rent wave is 100π seconds.
                     The average value of the power delivered to a 1  resistor by either a pe-
                 riodic current such as Eq. [16] or a nonperiodic current such as Eq. [15] may
                 be found by integrating over an infinite interval. Much of the actual inte-
                 gration can be avoided because of our thorough knowledge of the average
                 values of simple functions. We therefore obtain the average power delivered
                 by the current in Eq. [15] by applying Eq. [9]:
                                           
                                        1 τ/2
                             P = lim              (sin2 t + sin2 πt + 2 sin t sin πt) dt
                                  τ →∞ τ −τ/2

                      We now consider P as the sum of three average values. The average
                 value of sin2 t over an infinite interval is found by replacing sin2 t with
                 ( 12 − 12 cos 2t); the average is simply 12 . Similarly, the average value of sin2 πt
                 is also 12 . And the last term can be expressed as the sum of two cosine func-
                 tions, each of which must certainly have an average value of zero. Thus,
                                                        P = 12 + 12 = 1 W
                    An identical result is obtained for the periodic current of Eq. [16].
                 Applying this same method to a current function which is the sum of several
                 sinusoids of different periods and arbitrary amplitudes,
                               i(t) = Im1 cos ω1 t + Im2 cos ω2 t + · · · + Im N cos ω N t                         [17]
                 we find the average power delivered to a resistance R,
                                             2
                                      P = 12 Im1    2

                    The result is unchanged if an arbitrary phase angle is assigned to each
                 component of the current. This important result is surprisingly simple when
                 we think of the steps required for its derivation: squaring the current
                 function, integrating, and taking the limit. The result is also just plain

  EXAMPLE 11.6
                   Find the average power delivered to a 4  resistor by the current
                   i1  2 cos 10t − 3 cos 20t A.
                   Since the two cosine terms are at different frequencies, the two average-
                   power values may be calculated separately and added. Thus, this
                   current delivers 12 (22 )4 + 12 (32 )4 = 8 + 18 = 26 W to a 4  resistor.

                 (2) T1 = 2π and T2 = 2π/3.14. Therefore, we seek integral values of m and n such that 2πn = 2πm/3.14,
                 or 3.14n = m, or 314
                                  100 n = m or 157n = 50m. Thus, the smallest integral values for n and m are n = 50 and
                 m = 157. The period is therefore T = 2πn = 100π, or T = 2π(157/3.14) = 100π s.

surprising, because it shows that, in this special case of a current such as
Eq. [17], where each term has a unique frequency, superposition is applic-
able to power. Superposition is not applicable for a current which is the sum
of two direct currents, nor is it applicable for a current which is the sum of
two sinusoids of the same frequency.


11.3 EFFECTIVE VALUES OF CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
      •
In North America, most power outlets deliver a sinusoidal voltage having a
frequency of 60 Hz and a “voltage” of 115 V (elsewhere, 50 Hz and 240 V
are typically encountered). But what is meant by “115 volts”? This is cer-
tainly not the instantaneous value of the voltage, for the voltage is not a con-
stant. The value of 115 V is also not the amplitude which we have been
symbolizing as Vm; if we displayed the voltage waveform on a calibrated
oscilloscope, we√would find that the amplitude of this voltage at one of our
ac outlets is 115 2, or 162.6, volts. We also cannot fit the concept of an av-
erage value to the 115 V, because the average value of the sine wave is zero.
We might come a little closer by trying the magnitude of the average over a
positive or negative half cycle; by using a rectifier-type voltmeter at the out-
let, we should measure 103.5 V. As it turns out, however, 115 V is the
effective value of this sinusoidal voltage; it is a measure of the effectiveness
of a voltage source in delivering power to a resistive load.

Effective Value of a Periodic Waveform
Let us arbitrarily define effective value in terms of a current waveform, al-
though a voltage could equally well be selected. The effective value of any
periodic current is equal to the value of the direct current which, flowing
through an R ohm resistor, delivers the same average power to the resistor
as does the periodic current.
    In other words, we allow the given periodic current to flow through the
resistor, determine the instantaneous power i 2 R, and then find the average
value of i 2 R over a period; this is the average power. We then cause a direct

Thus the effective value of a sinusoidal current is a real quantity
                                                             √       which is in-
dependent of the phase angle and numerically
                                           √     equal  to 1/  2 =   0.707 times
the amplitude of the current. A current 2 cos(ωt + φ) A, therefore, has an
effective value of 1 A and will deliver the same average power to any resis-
tor as will a direct current of 1 A.       √
    It should be noted carefully that the 2 factor that we obtained as the ratio
of the amplitude of the periodic current to the effective value is applicable
only when the periodic function is sinusoidal. For a sawtooth waveform,√for
example, the effective value is equal to the maximum value divided by 3.
The factor by which the maximum value must be divided to obtain the effec-
tive value depends on the mathematical form of the given periodic function;
it may be either rational or irrational, depending on the nature of the function.

Use of RMS Values to Compute Average Power
The use of the effective value also simplifies slightly the expression for the
average power delivered by a sinusoidal current or voltage by avoiding use
of the factor 12 . For example, the average power delivered to an R ohm
resistor by a sinusoidal current is
                                  P = 12 Im2 R
                 √
Since Ieff = Im / 2, the average power may be written as
                                       2
                                  P = Ieff R                                   [20]    The fact that the effective value is defined in terms of an
The other power expressions may also be written in terms of effective values:          equivalent dc quantity provides us with average-power
                                                                                       formulas for resistive circuits which are identical with
                           P = Veff Ieff cos(θ − φ)                            [21]    those used in dc analysis.

                                 P = eff                                       [22]
                                          R
    Although we have succeeded in eliminating the factor 12 from our
average-power relationships, we must now take care to determine whether
a sinusoidal quantity is expressed in terms of its amplitude or its effective
value. In practice, the effective value is usually used in the fields of power
transmission or distribution and of rotating machinery; in the areas of elec-
tronics and communications, the amplitude is more often used. We will as-
sume that the amplitude is specified unless the term “rms” is explicitly used,
or we are otherwise instructed.
    In the sinusoidal steady state, phasor voltages and currents may be
given either as effective√values or as amplitudes; the two expressions dif-
fer only by a factor of 2. The voltage 50/30◦ V is expressed in terms of
an amplitude; as an rms voltage, we should describe the same voltage as
35.4/30◦ V rms.

Effective Value with Multiple-Frequency Circuits
In order to determine the effective value of a periodic or nonperiodic
waveform which is composed of the sum of a number of sinusoids of dif-
ferent frequencies, we may use the appropriate average-power relation-
ship of Eq. [18], developed in Sec. 11.2, rewritten in terms of the effective
values of the several components:
                           2      2
                     P = I1eff + I2eff + · · · + I N2 eff R              [23]

                                                        From this we see that the effective value of a current which is composed
                                                        of any number of sinusoidal currents of different frequencies can be
                                                        expressed as
                                                                                  

                                                        These results indicate that if a sinusoidal current of 5 A rms at 60 Hz flows
                                                        through a 2  resistor, an average power of 52 (2) = 50 W is absorbed by
                                                        the resistor; if a second current—perhaps 3 A rms at 120 Hz, for example—
                                                        is also present, the absorbed power is 32 (2) + 50 = 68 W. Using Eq. [24]
                                                        instead, we find that the effective value of the sum of the 60 and 120 Hz
                                                        currents is 5.831 A. Thus, P = 5.8312 (2) = 68 W as before. However,
                                                        if the second current is also at 60 Hz, the effective value of the sum of the
                                                        two 60 Hz currents may have any value between 2 and 8 A. Thus, the ab-
                                                        sorbed power may have any value between 8 W and 128 W, depending on
                                                        the relative phase of the two current components.

                                                         Several useful techniques are available through PSpice for calculation
                                                         of power quantities. In particular, the built-in functions of Probe allow

    As can be seen in Fig. 11.12, the average value of the power over
either one or two periods is 3.305 W, in agreement with the hand
calculation. Note that since PSpice only calculates at specific times, the
circuit was not simulated at precisely 8.333 ms and hence Cursor 1 in-
dicates a slightly higher average power.
    Probe also allows us to compute the average over a specific interval
using the built-in function avgx. For example, to use this function to
compute the average power over a single period, which in this case is
1/120 = 8.33 ms, we would enter
                      AVGX(I(R1) ∗ I(R1) ∗ 1000, 8.33 m)
Either approach will result in a value of 3.305 W at the endpoint of
the plot.

      11.4 APPARENT POWER AND POWER FACTOR
             •
      Historically, the introduction of the concepts of apparent power and power
      factor can be traced to the electric power industry, where large amounts of
      electric energy must be transferred from one point to another; the efficiency
      with which this transfer is effected is related directly to the cost of the elec-
      tric energy, which is eventually paid by the consumer. Customers who pro-
      vide loads which result in a relatively poor transmission efficiency must pay
      a greater price for each kilowatthour (kWh) of electric energy they actually
      receive and use. In a similar way, customers who require a costlier invest-
      ment in transmission and distribution equipment by the power company
      will also pay more for each kilowatthour unless the company is benevolent
      and enjoys losing money.
          Let us first define apparent power and power factor and then show
      briefly how these terms are related to practical economic situations. We
      assume that the sinusoidal voltage

                                        v = Vm cos(ωt + θ)

      is applied to a network and the resultant sinusoidal current is

                                         i = Im cos(ωt + φ)

      The phase angle by which the voltage leads the current is therefore (θ − φ).
      The average power delivered to the network, assuming a passive sign
                                       SECTION 11.4 APPARENT POWER AND POWER FACTOR                                                         439

convention at its input terminals, may be expressed either in terms of the
maximum values:

                          P = 12 Vm Im cos(θ − φ)

or in terms of the effective values:

                           P = Veff Ieff cos(θ − φ)

     If our applied voltage and current responses had been dc quantities,
the average power delivered to the network would have been given
simply by the product of the voltage and the current. Applying this dc                Apparent power is not a concept which is limited to
technique to the sinusoidal problem, we should obtain a value for the                 sinusoidal forcing functions and responses. It may be
absorbed power which is “apparently’’ given by the familiar product Veff              determined for any current and voltage waveshapes by
Ieff. However, this product of the effective values of the voltage and cur-           simply taking the product of the effective values of the
rent is not the average power; we define it as the apparent power. Di-                current and voltage.
mensionally, apparent power must be measured in the same units as real
power, since cos(θ − φ) is dimensionless; but in order to avoid confu-
sion, the term volt-amperes, or VA, is applied to the apparent power.
Since cos(θ − φ) cannot have a magnitude greater than unity, the magni-
tude of the real power can never be greater than the magnitude of the
apparent power.
     The ratio of the real or average power to the apparent power is called the
power factor, symbolized by PF. Hence,

                             average power      P
                      PF =                  =
                             apparent power   Veff Ieff

In the sinusoidal case, the power factor is simply cos(θ − φ), where
(θ − φ) is the angle by which the voltage leads the current. This relation-
ship is the reason why the angle (θ − φ) is often referred to as the PF
angle.
    For a purely resistive load, the voltage and current are in phase, (θ − φ)
is zero, and the PF is unity. In other words, the apparent power and the
average power are equal. Unity PF, however, may also be achieved for loads
that contain both inductance and capacitance if the element values and
the operating frequency are carefully selected to provide an input imped-
ance having a zero phase angle. A purely reactive load, that is, one contain-
ing no resistance, will cause a phase difference between the voltage and
current of either plus or minus 90°, and the PF is therefore zero.
    Between these two extreme cases there are the general networks for
which the PF can range from zero to unity. A PF of 0.5, for example, indi-
cates a load having an input impedance with a phase angle of either 60° or
−60◦ ; the former describes an inductive load, since the voltage leads the
current by 60°, while the latter refers to a capacitive load. The ambiguity in
the exact nature of the load is resolved by referring to a leading PF or a lag-
ging PF, the terms leading or lagging referring to the phase of the current
with respect to the voltage. Thus, an inductive load will have a lagging PF
and a capacitive load a leading PF.

   The total average power delivered to the source is 288 + 144 = 432 W.
   The average power supplied by the source is
  P = Veff Ieff cos(ang V − ang I) = (60)(12) cos(0 + 53.13◦ ) = 432 W

11.5 COMPLEX POWER
      •
As we saw in Chap. 10, “complex” numbers do not actually “complicate”
analysis. By allowing us to carry two pieces of information together
through a series of calculations via the “real” and “imaginary” compo-
nents, they often greatly simplify what might otherwise be tedious calcu-
lations. This is particularly true with power, since we have resistive as
well as inductive and capacitive elements in a general load. In this sec-
tion, we define complex power to allow us to calculate the various con-
tributions to the total power in a clean, efficient fashion. The magnitude
of the complex power is simply the apparent power. The real part is the
average power and—as we are about to see—the imaginary part is a new
quantity, termed the reactive power, which describes the rate of energy
transfer into and out of reactive load components (e.g., inductors and
capacitors).
     We define complex power with reference to a general sinusoidal voltage
Veff = Veff/θ across a pair of terminals and a general sinusoidal current
Ieff = Ieff φ flowing into one of the terminals in such a way as to satisfy
the passive sign convention. The average power P absorbed by the two-
terminal network is thus
                            P = Veff Ieff cos(θ − φ)

Complex nomenclature is next introduced by making use of Euler’s formula
in the same way as we did in introducing phasors. We express P as
                            P = Veff Ieff Re{e j (θ−φ) }

                                                               sign, which is not present in the expression for the phasor current. That is,
                                                               the phasor current is

                                                               and we therefore must make use of conjugate notation:

                                                               Hence
                                                                                                P = Re{Veff I∗eff }
                                                               and we may now let power become complex by defining the complex power

load). A great deal of qualitative information concerning our load is there-
fore available at a glance.
    Another interpretation of reactive power may be seen by constructing a
phasor diagram containing Veff and Ieff as shown in Fig. 11.16. If the phasor
current is resolved into two components, one in phase with the voltage, hav-
ing a magnitude Ieff cos(θ − φ), and one 90° out of phase with the voltage,
with magnitude equal to Ieff sin |θ − φ|, then it is clear that the real power
is given by the product of the magnitude of the voltage phasor and the
component of the phasor current which is in phase with the voltage. More-
over, the product of the magnitude of the voltage phasor and the component
of the phasor current which is 90° out of phase with the voltage is the reac-
tive power Q. It is common to speak of the component of a phasor which is
90° out of phase with some other phasor as a quadrature component. Thus
Q is simply Veff times the quadrature component of Ieff. Q is also known as
the quadrature power.

Power Measurement
Strictly speaking, a wattmeter measures average real power P drawn by a
load, and a varmeter reads the average reactive power Q drawn by a

          The necessary load impedance Z2 may be found in several simple
       steps. We select a phase angle of 0° for the voltage source, and
       therefore the current drawn by Z2 is

       If the operating frequency is 60 Hz, this load can be provided by a
       1056 μF capacitor connected in parallel with the motor. However, its
       initial cost, maintenance, and depreciation must be covered by the
       reduction in the electric bill.

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In this chapter, we introduced a fair number of new power-related terms
(summarized in Table 11.2), which might have come as a bit of a surprise af-
ter watts did so well for us up to this point. The new terminology is largely
relevant to ac power systems, where voltages and currents are generally as-
sumed to be sinusoidal (the prevalence of switched-mode power supplies in
many computer systems can alter this situation, a topic of more advanced
power engineering texts). After clarifying what is meant by instantaneous
power, we discussed the concept of average power P. This quantity is not a
function of time, but is a strong function of the phase difference between
sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms. Purely reactive elements such as
ideal inductors and capacitors absorb zero average power. Since such ele-
ments do increase the magnitude of the current flowing between the source
and load, however, two new terms find common usage: apparent power and
power factor. The average power and apparent power are identical when
voltage and current are in phase (i.e., associated with a purely resistive
load). The power factor gives us a numerical guage of how reactive a

      particular load is: a unity power factor (PF) corresponds to a purely resistive
      load (if inductors are present, they are being “canceled” by an appropriate
      capacitance); a zero PF indicates a purely reactive load, and the sign of the
      angle indicates whether the load is capacitive or inductive. Putting all of
      these concepts together allowed us to create a more compact representation
      known as complex power, S. The magnitude of S is the apparent power, P is
      the real part of S, and Q, the reactive power (zero for resistive loads), is the
      imaginary part of S.
          Along the way, we paused to introduce the notion of effective values of
      current and voltage, often referred to as rms values. Care must be taken
      from this point forward to establish whether a particular voltage or current
      value is being quoted as a magnitude or its corresponding rms value, as an
      ∼40% error can be introduced. Interestingly, we also discovered an exten-
      sion of the maximum power theorem encountered in Chap. 5, namely, that
      maximum average power is delivered to a load whose impedance ZL is the
      complex conjugate of the Thévenin equivalent impedance of the network to
      which it is connected.
          For convenience, key points of the chapter are summarized below, along
      with corresponding example numbers.
      ❑ The instantaneous power absorbed by an element is given by the
          expression p(t) = v(t)i(t). (Examples 11.1, 11.2)
      ❑ The average power delivered to an impedance by a sinusoidal source
          is 12 Vm Im cos(θ − φ), where θ = the voltage phase angle and φ = the
          phase angle of the current. (Example 11.2)
      ❑ Only the resistive component of a load draws nonzero average power.
          The average power delivered to the reactive component of a load is
          zero. (Examples 11.3, 11.4)
      ❑ Maximum average power transfer occurs when the condition Z L = Z∗th
          is satisfied. (Example 11.5)
      ❑ When multiple sources are present, each operating at a different
          frequency, the individual contributions to average power may be
          summed. This is not true for sources operating at the same frequency.
          (Examples 11.6, 11.7)
      ❑ The effective or rms value√of a sinusoidal waveform is obtained by
          dividing its amplitude by 2.
      ❑ The power factor (PF) of a load is the ratio of its average dissipated
          power to the apparent power. (Example 11.8)
      ❑ A purely resistive load will have a unity power factor. A purely reactive
          load will have a zero power factor. (Example 11.8)
      ❑ Complex power is defined as S = P + jQ, or S = Veff I∗eff . It is measured
          in units of volt-amperes (VA). (Example 11.9)
      ❑ Reactive power Q is the imaginary component of the complex power,
          and is a measure of the energy flow rate into or out of the reactive
          components of a load. Its unit is the volt-ampere-reactive (VAR).
          (Example 11.9)
      ❑ Capacitors are commonly used to improve the PF of industrial loads
          to minimize the reactive power required from the utility company.

          INTRODUCTION
          The vast majority of power is supplied to consumers in the form of       Three-Phase Power Systems
          sinusoidal voltages and currents, typically referred to as alternating
          current or simply ac. Although there are exceptions, for example,        Three-Phase Sources
          some types of train motors, most equipment is designed to run on
          either 50 or 60 Hz. Most 60 Hz systems are now standardized to           Line Versus Phase Voltage
          run on 120 V, whereas 50 Hz systems typically correspond to
          240 V (both voltages being quoted in rms units). The actual voltage      Line Versus Phase Current
          delivered to an appliance can vary somewhat from these values,
          and distribution systems employ significantly higher voltages to         Y-Connected Networks
          minimize the current and hence cable size. Originally Thomas
          Edison advocated a purely dc power distribution network, purport-        -Connected Networks
          edly due to his preference for the simple algebra required to
          analyze such circuits. Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, two         Balanced Loads
          other pioneers in the field of electricity, proposed ac distribution
          systems as the achievable losses were significantly lower. Ulti-         Per-Phase Analysis
          mately they were more persuasive, despite some rather theatrical
          demonstrations on the part of Edison.                                    Power Measurement in
              The transient response of ac power systems is of interest            Three-Phase Systems
          when determining the peak power demand, since most equipment
          requires more current to start up than it does to run continuously.
          Often, however, it is the steady-state operation that is of primary
          interest, so our experience with phasor-based analysis will prove to
          be handy. In this chapter we introduce a new type of voltage
          source, the three-phase source, which can be connected in either a
          three- or four-wire Y configuration or a three-wire  configuration.
          Loads can also be either Y- or -connected, depending on the
          application.

      12.1           POLYPHASE SYSTEMS
                 •
      So far, whenever we used the term “sinusoidal source’’ we pictured a single
      sinusoidal voltage or current having a particular amplitude, frequency, and
      phase. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of polyphase sources, focus-
      ing on three-phase systems in particular. There are distinct advantages in us-
      ing rotating machinery to generate three-phase power rather than single-
      phase power, and there are economical advantages in favor of the
      transmission of power in a three-phase system. Although most of the electri-
      cal equipment we have encountered so far is single-phase, three-phase
      equipment is not uncommon, especially in manufacturing environments. In
      particular, motors used in large refrigeration systems and in machining facil-
      ities are often wired for three-phase power. For the remaining applications,
      once we have become familiar with the basics of polyphase systems, we will
      find that it is simple to obtain single-phase power by just connecting to a sin-
      gle “leg’’ of a polyphase system.
          Let us look briefly at the most common polyphase system, a balanced
      three-phase system. The source has three terminals (not counting a neutral
      or ground connection), and voltmeter measurements will show that sinu-
      soidal voltages of equal amplitude are present between any two terminals.
      However, these voltages are not in phase; each of the three voltages is 120°
      out of phase with each of the other two, the sign of the phase angle depend-
      ing on the sense of the voltages. One possible set of voltages is shown in
      Fig. 12.1. A balanced load draws power equally from all three phases. At no
      instant does the instantaneous power drawn by the total load reach zero;
      in fact, the total instantaneous power is constant. This is an advantage in
      rotating machinery, for it keeps the torque on the rotor much more constant
      than it would be if a single-phase source were used. As a result, there is less
      vibration.

would be redundant. With reference to Fig. 12.2b, for example, we see that
Vad = Vab + Vcd . The advantage of the double-subscript notation lies in
the fact that Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires the voltage between two
points to be the same, regardless of the path chosen between the points;                                                    c

    The name single-phase arises because the voltages Van and Vnb, being
equal, must have the same phase angle. From another viewpoint, however,
the voltages between the outer wires and the central wire, which is usually re-
ferred to as the neutral, are exactly 180◦ out of phase. That is, Van = −Vbn ,
and Van + Vbn = 0. Later, we will see that balanced polyphase systems are
characterized by a set of voltages of equal amplitude whose (phasor) sum is
zero. From this viewpoint, then, the single-phase three-wire system is really
a balanced two-phase system. Two-phase, however, is a term that is tradi-
tionally reserved for a relatively unimportant unbalanced system utilizing
two voltage sources 90° out of phase.                                                                     a                    A

Thus there is no current in the neutral wire, and it could be removed with-
out changing any current or voltage in the system. This result is achieved
through the equality of the two loads and of the two sources.

Effect of Finite Wire Impedance
We next consider the effect of a finite impedance in each of the wires. If
lines a A and bB each have the same impedance, this impedance may be
added to Z p , resulting in two equal loads once more, and zero neutral cur-
rent. Now let us allow the neutral wire to possess some impedance Zn .
Without carrying out any detailed analysis, superposition should show us
that the symmetry of the circuit will still cause zero neutral current. More-
over, the addition of any impedance connected directly from one of the
outer lines to the other outer line also yields a symmetrical circuit and zero
neutral current. Thus, zero neutral current is a consequence of a balanced, or
symmetrical, load; nonzero impedance in the neutral wire does not destroy
the symmetry.
    The most general single-phase three-wire system will contain unequal
loads between each outside line and the neutral and another load directly
between the two outer lines; the impedances of the two outer lines may be
expected to be approximately equal, but the neutral impedance is often
slightly larger. Let us consider an example of such a system, with particular
interest in the current that may flow now through the neutral wire, as well as
the overall efficiency with which our system is transmitting power to the
unbalanced load.

                  Identify the goal of the problem.
                    The three loads in the circuit are the 50  resistor, the 100  resistor,
                    and a 20 + j10  impedance. Each of the two lines has a resistance
                    of 1 , and the neutral wire has a resistance of 3 . We need the cur-
                    rent through each of these in order to determine power.

                  Collect the known information.
                    We have a single-phase three-wire system; the circuit diagram of
                    Fig. 12.9 is completely labeled. The computed currents will be in
                    rms units.

                  Devise a plan.
                    The circuit is conducive to mesh analysis, having three clearly defined
                    meshes. The result of the analysis will be a set of mesh currents,
                    which can then be used to compute absorbed power.

                  Construct an appropriate set of equations.
                    The three mesh equations are:
                                   −115/0◦ + I1 + 50(I1 − I2 ) + 3(I1 − I3 ) = 0
                                 (20 + j10)I2 + 100(I2 − I3 ) + 50(I2 − I1 ) = 0
                                 −115/0◦ + 3(I3 − I1 ) + 100(I3 − I2 ) + I3 = 0
                    which can be rearranged to obtain the following three equations
                                  54I1                −50I2           −3I3           = 115/0◦
                                 −50I1       + (170 + j10)I2         −100I3          =0
                                  −3I1               −100I2          +104I3          = 115/0◦

                  Determine if additional information is required.
                    We have a set of three equations in three unknowns, so it is possible
                    to attempt a solution at this point.
                                       SECTION 12.2 SINGLE-PHASE THREE-WIRE SYSTEMS                                                         463


 Attempt a solution.
  Solving for the phasor currents I1 , I2 , and I3 using a scientific calcula-
  tor, we find
                            I1 = 11.24/−19.83◦ A
                            I2 = 9.389/−24.47◦ A
                            I3 = 10.37/−21.80◦ A
  The currents in the outer lines are thus
                        Ia A = I1 = 11.24/−19.83◦ A
  and
                       IbB = −I3 = 10.37/158.20◦ A
  and the smaller neutral current is
                     In N = I3 − I1 = 0.9459/−177.7◦ A
  The average power drawn by each load may thus be determined:
                         P50 = |I1 − I2 |2 (50) = 206 W
                        P100 = |I3 − I2 |2 (100) = 117 W                              Note that we do not need to include a factor of 12 since
                     P20+ j10 = |I2 |2 (20) = 1763 W                                  we are working with rms current values.

  The total load power is 2086 W. The loss in each of the wires is next
  found:
                           Pa A = |I1 |2 (1) = 126 W
                           PbB = |I3 |2 (1) = 108 W
                           Pn N = |In N |2 (3) = 3 W
                                                                                      Imagine the heat produced by two 100 W light bulbs!
  giving a total line loss of 237 W. The wires are evidently quite long;              These outer wires must dissipate the same amount
  otherwise, the relatively high power loss in the two outer lines would              of power. In order to keep their temperature down,
  cause a dangerous temperature rise.                                                 a large surface area is required.

 Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
  The total absorbed power is 206 + 117 + 1763 + 237, or 2323 W,
  which may be checked by finding the power delivered by each voltage
  source:
                   Pan = 115(11.24) cos 19.83◦ = 1216 W
                   Pbn = 115(10.37) cos 21.80◦ = 1107 W
  or a total of 2323 W. The transmission efficiency for the system is
              total power delivered to load      2086
        η=                                  =            = 89.8%
                  total power generated       2086 + 237
  This value would be unbelievable for a steam engine or an internal
  combustion engine, but it is too low for a well-designed distribution
  system. Larger-diameter wires should be used if the source and the
  load cannot be placed closer to each other.                                                                  (Continued on next page)

The actual phase sequence of a physical three-phase source depends on the
arbitrary choice of the three terminals to be lettered a, b, and c. They may
always be chosen to provide positive phase sequence, and we will assume
that this has been done in most of the systems we consider.

Line-to-Line Voltages
Let us next find the line-to-line voltages (often simply called the line
voltages) which are present when the phase voltages are those of Fig. 12.12a.                                       Vcn                          Vab

all multiples of 30◦. The necessary construction is shown in Fig. 12.13; the

    Note that with positive phase sequence, Van leads Vbn and Vbn leads
Vcn , in each case by 120◦ , and also that Vab leads Vbc and Vbc leads Vca ,
again by 120◦ . The statement is true for negative phase sequence if “lags’’
is substituted for “leads.’’

                 phase circuits that possess one common lead:2

                                         IcC = Ia A /−240◦
                 and therefore
                                                  I N n = Ia A + IbB + IcC = 0
                     Thus, the neutral carries no current if the source and load are both bal-
                 anced and if the four wires have zero impedance. How will this change if an
                 impedance Z L is inserted in series with each of the three lines and an imped-
                 ance Zn is inserted in the neutral? The line impedances may be combined with
                 the three load impedances; this effective load is still balanced, and a perfectly
                 conducting neutral wire could be removed. Thus, if no change is produced in
                 the system with a short circuit or an open circuit between n and N, any imped-
                 ance may be inserted in the neutral and the neutral current will remain zero.
                     It follows that, if we have balanced sources, balanced loads, and bal-
                 anced line impedances, a neutral wire of any impedance may be replaced
                 by any other impedance, including a short circuit or an open circuit; the
                 replacement will not affect the system’s voltages or currents. It is often
                 helpful to visualize a short circuit between the two neutral points, whether a
                 neutral wire is actually present or not; the problem is then reduced to three
                 single-phase problems, all identical except for the consistent difference in
                 phase angle. We say that we thus work the problem on a “per-phase’’ basis.

 Since one of the source phase voltages is given and we are told to use
 the positive phase sequence, the three phase voltages are:
  Van = 200/0◦ V         Vbn = 200/−120◦ V          Vcn = 200/−240◦ V
                         √
 The line voltage is 200 3 = 346 V; the phase angle of each line volt-
 age can be determined by constructing a phasor diagram, as we did in
 Fig. 12.13 (as a matter of fact, the phasor diagram of Fig. 12.13 is
 applicable), subtracting the phase voltages using a scientific calculator,
 or by invoking Eqs. [1] to [3]. We find that Vab is 346/30◦ V,
 Vbc = 346/−90◦ V, and Vca = 346/−210◦ V.
    The line current for phase A is
                            Van   200/0◦
                   Ia A =       =         = 2/−60◦ A

 Since we know this is a balanced three-phase system, we may write the
 remaining line currents based on Ia A :                                                               Vcn

 Finally, the average power absorbed by phase A is Re{Van Ia∗ A }, or                                                 60⬚

                                                                                                                      IaA

 Thus, the total average power drawn by the three-phase load is 600 W.

   Before working another example, this would be a good opportunity to
quickly explore a statement made in Sec. 12.1, i.e., that even though phase
voltages and currents have zero value at specific instants in time (every
1/120 s in North America), the instantaneous power delivered to the total
load is never zero. Consider phase A of Example 12.2 once more, with the
phase voltage and current written in the time domain:
                               √                                                                     
                                                                                     The factor of    2 is required to convert from rms units.
                     v AN = 200 2 cos(120πt + 0◦ ) V
and
                             √
                     i AN = 2 2 cos(120πt − 60◦ ) A
468              CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS


                 Thus, the instantaneous power absorbed by phase A is
                           p A (t) = v AN i AN = 800 cos(120πt) cos(120πt − 60◦ )
                                               = 400[cos(−60◦ ) + cos(240πt − 60◦ )]
                                               = 200 + 400 cos(240πt − 60◦ ) W

                 in a similar fashion,

                                      p B (t) = 200 + 400 cos(240πt − 300◦ ) W

                 and

                                      pC (t) = 200 + 400 cos(240πt − 180◦ ) W

                 The instantaneous power absorbed by the total load is therefore

                                      p(t) = p A (t) + p B (t) + pC (t) = 600 W

                 independent of time, and the same value as the average power computed in
                 Example 12.2.

                  The phase voltage is 300/ 3 V and the per-phase power is 1200/3 =
                  400 W. Thus the line current may be found from the power relationship

                  and the line current is therefore 2.89 A. The phase impedance magnitude
                  is given by

                               |I1 | = 1.155 A
In a similar way, the amplitude of the capacitive load current (labeled I2 )
is found to be unchanged from its previous value, since the voltage
across it has remained the same:
                                |I2 | = 2.89 A
If we assume that the phase with which we are working has a phase
voltage with an angle of 0◦ , then since cos−1 (0.8) = 36.9◦,
                I1 = 1.155/0◦ A         I2 = 2.89/+36.9◦ A
and the line current is
                      I L = I1 + I2 = 3.87/+26.6◦ A
We can check our results by computing the power generated by this
phase of the source

                   Pp = √ 3.87 cos(+26.6◦ ) = 600 W
                          3
which agrees with the fact that the individual phase is known to be sup-
plying 200 W to the new lighting load, as well as 400 W to the original
load.

          If an unbalanced Y-connected load is present in an otherwise balanced
      three-phase system, the circuit may still be analyzed on a per-phase basis if
      the neutral wire is present and if it has zero impedance. If either of these
      conditions is not met, other methods must be used, such as mesh or nodal
      analysis. However, engineers who spend most of their time with unbalanced
      three-phase systems will find the use of symmetrical components a great
      time saver.
          We leave this topic for more advanced texts.

              •
      An alternative to the Y-connected load is the -connected configuration, as
      shown in Fig. 12.18. This type of configuration is very common, and does
      not possess a neutral connection.

      ■ FIGURE 12.18 A balanced -connected load is present on a three-
        wire three-phase system. The source happens to be Y-connected.

          Let us consider a balanced -connected load which consists of an imped-
      ance Z p inserted between each pair of lines. With reference to Fig. 12.18, let
      us assume known line voltages
                                    VL = |Vab | = |Vbc | = |Vca |
      or known phase voltages
                                    Vp = |Van | = |Vbn | = |Vcn |
      where
                                   √                                  √
                            VL =    3Vp        and            Vab =    3Vp /30◦
      as we found previously. Because the voltage across each branch of the  is
      known, the phase currents are easily found:
                            Vab              Vbc            Vca
                     I AB =          I BC =          IC A =
                            Zp               Zp             Zp
      and their differences provide us with the line currents, such as
                                           Ia A = I AB − IC A
      Since we are working with a balanced system, the three phase currents are
      of equal amplitude:
                                    I p = |I AB | = |I BC | = |IC A |
      The line currents are also equal in amplitude; the symmetry is apparent from
      the phasor diagram of Fig. 12.19. We thus have
                                     I L = |Ia A | = |IbB | = |IcC |
      and

   Let us disregard the source for the moment and consider only the bal-
anced load. If the load is -connected, then the phase voltage and the line
voltage are indistinguishable,
                      √        but the line current is larger than the phase
current by a factor of 3; with a Y-connected load, however, the phase cur-
rent and the line current refer to the same current,
                                             √       and the line voltage is
greater than the phase voltage by a factor of 3.

 Determine the amplitude of the line current in a three-phase system
 with a line voltage of 300 V that supplies 1200 W to a -connected
 load at a lagging PF of 0.8; then find the phase impedance.
 Let us again consider a single phase. It draws 400 W, 0.8 lagging PF, at
 a 300 V line voltage. Thus,                                                                    Again, keep in mind that we are assuming all voltages
                                                                                                and currents are quoted as rms values.
                                    400 = 300(I p )(0.8)
 and
                                         I p = 1.667 A
  and the relationship between phase currents and line currents yields

                         I L = 3(1.667) = 2.89 A
 Next, the phase angle of the load is cos−1 (0.8) = 36.9◦ , and therefore
 the impedance in each phase must be

  EXAMPLE 12.6
                  Determine the amplitude of the line current in a three-phase
                  system with a 300 V line voltage that supplies 1200 W to a
                  Y-connected load at a lagging PF of 0.8. (This is the same circuit
                  as in Example 12.5, but with a Y-connected load instead.)
                                                                            √
                  On a per-phase basis, we now have a phase voltage of 300/ 3 V,
                  a power of 400 W, and a lagging PF of 0.8. Thus,
                                                       300
                                                 400 = √ (I p )(0.8)

                                      I p = 2.89       (and so I L = 2.89 A)
                  The phase angle of the load is again 36.9◦ , and thus the impedance in
                  each phase of the Y is

                     The 3 factor not only relates phase and line quantities but also appears
                 in a useful expression for the total power drawn by any balanced three-
                 phase load. If we assume a Y-connected load with a power-factor angle θ ,
                 the power taken by any phase is

                 and the total power is

                 In a similar way, the power delivered to each phase of a -connected load is

-Connected Sources
The source may also be connected in a  configuration. This is not typical,
however, for a slight unbalance in the source phases can lead to large cur-
rents circulating in the  loop. For example, let us call the three single-
phase sources Vab , Vbc , and Vcd . Before closing the  by connecting d to a,
let us determine the unbalance by measuring the sum Vab + Vbc + Vca .
Suppose that the amplitude of the result is only 1 percent of the line voltage.
The circulating current is thus approximately 13 percent of the line voltage
divided by the internal impedance of any source. How large is this impedance
apt to be? It must depend on the current that the source is expected to deliver
with a negligible drop in terminal voltage. If we assume that this maximum
current causes a 1 percent drop in the terminal voltage, then the circulating
current is one-third of the maximum current! This reduces the useful current
capacity of the source and also increases the losses in the system.

          We should also note that balanced three-phase sources may be trans-
      formed from Y to , or vice versa, without affecting the load currents or
      voltages. The necessary relationships between the line and phase voltages
      are shown in Fig. 12.13 for the case where Van has a reference phase angle
      of 0◦ . This transformation enables us to use whichever source connection
      we prefer, and all the load relationships will be correct. Of course, we can-
      not specify any currents or voltages within the source until we know how it
      is actually connected. Balanced three-phase loads may be transformed
      between Y- and -connected configurations using the relation

      12.5      POWER MEASUREMENT IN
             • THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
      Use of the Wattmeter
      In large electrical systems, not only are voltage and current important to
      know, but power is quoted so often that measuring it directly proves highly
      valuable. This is typically performed using a device known as a wattmeter,
      which must have the ability to establish both the voltage and the current
      associated with either the source, the load, or both. Modern devices are very
      similar to the digital multimeter, providing a numerical display of the quan-
      tity being measured. These devices frequently make use of the fact that
      current gives rise to a magnetic field, which can be measured without break-
      ing the circuit. However, in the field we still encounter analog versions of
      the multimeter, and they continue to have some advantages over digital
      versions, such as the ability to function without a separate power source
      (e.g., battery), and secondary information that comes from watching a
      needle move as opposed to numbers seemingly jumping around randomly
      on a display. Thus, in this section, we focus on power measurement using a
      traditional analog meter, as switching to a digital device is straightforward if
      one is available. Before embarking on a discussion of the specialized tech-
      niques used to measure power in three-phase systems, it is to our advantage
      to briefly consider how a wattmeter is used in a single-phase circuit.
          Power measurement is most often accomplished at frequencies below a
      few hundred hertz through the use of a wattmeter that contains two separate
      coils. One of these coils is made of heavy wire, having a very low resis-
      tance, and is called the current coil; the second coil is composed of a much
      greater number of turns of fine wire, with relatively high resistance, and is
      termed the potential coil, or voltage coil. Additional resistance may also be
      inserted internally or externally in series with the potential coil. The torque
      applied to the moving system and the pointer is proportional to the instanta-
      neous product of the currents flowing in the two coils. The mechanical iner-
      tia of the moving system, however, causes a deflection that is proportional
      to the average value of this torque.
          The wattmeter is used by connecting it into a network in such a way that
      the current flowing in the current coil is the current flowing into the network

and the voltage across the potential coil is the voltage across the two terminals
of the network. The current in the potential coil is thus the input voltage di-
vided by the resistance of the potential coil.
    It is apparent that the wattmeter has four available terminals, and correct
connections must be made to these terminals in order to obtain an upscale
reading on the meter. To be specific, let us assume that we are measuring the
power absorbed by a passive network. The current coil is inserted in series
with one of the two conductors connected to the load, and the potential coil
is installed between the two conductors, usually on the “load side’’ of the
current coil. The potential coil terminals are often indicated by arrows, as
shown in Fig. 12.23a. Each coil has two terminals, and the proper relation-
ship between the sense of the current and voltage must be observed. One
end of each coil is usually marked (+), and an upscale reading is obtained
if a positive current is flowing into the (+) end of the current coil while the
(+) terminal of the potential coil is positive with respect to the unmarked
end. The wattmeter shown in the network of Fig. 12.23a therefore gives an
upscale deflection when the network to the right is absorbing power. A re-
versal of either coil, but not both, will cause the meter to try to deflect down-
scale; a reversal of both coils will never affect the reading.
    As an example of the use of such a wattmeter in measuring average
power, let us consider the circuit shown in Fig. 12.23b. The connection of
the wattmeter is such that an upscale reading corresponds to a positive ab-
sorbed power for the network to the right of the meter, that is, the right
source. The power absorbed by this source is given by
                              P = |V2 | |I| cos(ang V2 − ang I)
478   CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS


      Using superposition or mesh analysis, we find the current is

                                          I = 11.18/153.4◦ A
      and thus the absorbed power is
                    P = (100)(11.18) cos(0◦ − 153.4◦ ) = −1000 W

      The pointer therefore rests against the downscale stop. In practice, the
      potential coil can be reversed more quickly than the current coil, and this
      reversal provides an upscale reading of 1000 W.

      The Wattmeter in a Three-Phase System
      At first glance, measurement of the power drawn by a three-phase load
      seems to be a simple problem. We need place only one wattmeter in each of
      the three phases and add the results. For example, the proper connections
      for a Y-connected load are shown in Fig. 12.25a. Each wattmeter has its cur-
      rent coil inserted in one phase of the load and its potential coil connected
      between the line side of that load and the neutral. In a similar way, three
      wattmeters may be connected as shown in Fig. 12.25b to measure the total
      power taken by a -connected load. The methods are theoretically correct,
      but they may be useless in practice because the neutral of the Y is not al-
      ways accessible and the phases of the  are not available. A three-phase ro-
      tating machine, for example, has only three accessible terminals, those
      which we have been calling A, B, and C.
          Clearly, we have a need for a method of measuring the total power
      drawn by a three-phase load having only three accessible terminals; mea-
      surements may be made on the “line’’ side of these terminals, but not on
      the “load’’ side. Such a method is available, and is capable of measuring the
      power taken by an unbalanced load from an unbalanced source. Let us

      Reference to the circuit diagram shows that this sum is indeed the sum of
      the average powers taken by each phase of the load, and the sum of the read-
      ings of the three wattmeters therefore represents the total average power
      drawn by the entire load!
          Let us illustrate this procedure with a numerical example before we dis-
      cover that one of these three wattmeters is really superfluous. We will as-
      sume a balanced source,

Let us assume ideal wattmeters, connected as illustrated in Fig. 12.26, with
point x located on the neutral of the source n. The three line currents may be
obtained by mesh analysis,
                            Ia A = 19.32/15◦ A
                            IbB = 19.32/165◦ A

The voltage between the neutrals is
           Vn N = Vnb + V B N = Vnb + IbB ( j10) = 157.7/−90◦
The average power indicated by each wattmeter may be calculated,

or a total power of 1 kW. Since an rms current of 10 A flows through the
resistive load, the total power drawn by the load is
                            P = 102 (10) = 1 kW
and the two methods agree.

The Two-Wattmeter Method
We have proved that point x, the common connection of the three potential
coils, may be located any place we wish without affecting the algebraic sum
of the three wattmeter readings. Let us now consider the effect of placing
point x, this common connection of the three wattmeters, directly on one of
the lines. If, for example, one end of each potential coil is returned to B, then
there is no voltage across the potential coil of wattmeter B and this meter
must read zero. It may therefore be removed, and the algebraic sum of the
remaining two wattmeter readings is still the total power drawn by the load.
When the location of x is selected in this way, we describe the method of
power measurement as the two-wattmeter method. The sum of the readings
indicates the total power, regardless of (1) load unbalance, (2) source un-
balance, (3) differences in the two wattmeters, and (4) the waveform of the
periodic source. The only assumption we have made is that wattmeter cor-
rections are sufficiently small that we can ignore them. In Fig. 12.26, for
example, the current coil of each meter has passing through it the line
current drawn by the load plus the current taken by the potential coil. Since
the latter current is usually quite small, its effect may be estimated from a
knowledge of the resistance of the potential coil and voltage across it. These
two quantities enable a close estimate to be made of the power dissipated in
the potential coil.
    In the numerical example described previously, let us now assume that
two wattmeters are used, one with current coil in line A and potential coil
between lines A and B, the other with current coil in line C and potential coil

      between C and B. The first meter reads
                       P1 = V AB Ia A cos(ang V AB − ang Ia A )
                          = 100(19.32) cos(0◦ − 15◦ )
                          = 1866 W
      and the second
                            P2 = VCB IcC cos(ang VCB − ang IcC )
                               = 100(10) cos(60◦ + 90◦ )
                               = −866 W
      and, therefore,
                           P = P1 + P2 = 1866 − 866 = 1000 W
      as we expect from recent experience with the circuit.
         In the case of a balanced load, the two-wattmeter method enables the PF
      angle to be determined, as well as the total power drawn by the load. Let us
      assume a load impedance with a phase angle θ ; either a Y or  connection
      may be used and we will assume the  connection shown in Fig. 12.27. The
      construction of a standard phasor diagram, such as that of Fig. 12.19, en-
      ables us to determine the proper phase angle between the several line volt-
      ages and line currents. We therefore determine the readings
                         P1 = |V AB | |Ia A | cos(ang V AB − ang Ia A )
                            = VL I L cos(30◦ + θ)
      and
                          P2 = |VC B | |IcC | cos(ang VC B − ang IcC )
                             = VL I L cos(30◦ − θ)
      The ratio of the two readings is
                                  P1    cos(30◦ + θ)
                                      =                                         [5]
                                  P2    cos(30◦ − θ)
      If we expand the cosine terms, this equation is easily solved for tan θ ,
                                          √ P2 − P1
                                 tan θ = 3                                      [6]
                                             P2 + P1
                                 SECTION 12.5 POWER MEASUREMENT IN THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS                 483

     Thus, equal wattmeter readings indicate a unity PF load; equal and op-
posite readings indicate a purely reactive load; a reading of P2 which is
(algebraically) greater than P1 indicates an inductive impedance; and a
reading of P2 which is less than P1 signifies a capacitive load. How can we
tell which wattmeter reads P1 and which reads P2? It is true that P1 is in line
A, and P2 is in line C, and our positive phase-sequence system forces Van to
lag Vcn . This is enough information to differentiate between two watt-
meters, but it is confusing to apply in practice. Even if we were unable to
distinguish between the two, we know the magnitude of the phase angle, but
not its sign. This is often sufficient information; if the load is an induction
motor, the angle must be positive and we do not need to make any tests to
determine which reading is which. If no previous knowledge of the load is
assumed, then there are several methods of resolving the ambiguity. Perhaps
the simplest method is that which involves adding a high-impedance reac-
tive load, say, a three-phase capacitor, across the unknown load. The load
must become more capacitive. Thus, if the magnitude of tan θ (or the mag-
nitude of θ ) decreases, then the load was inductive, whereas an increase in
the magnitude of tan θ signifies an original capacitive impedance.

                                                                                            EXAMPLE 12.7
 The balanced load in Fig. 12.28 is fed by a balanced three-phase
 system having Vab = 230/0◦ V rms and positive phase sequence.
 Find the reading of each wattmeter and the total power drawn
 by the load.
 The potential coil of wattmeter #1 is connected to measure the voltage
 Vac , and its current coil is measuring the phase current Ia A . Since we
 know to use the positive phase sequence, the line voltages are
                                Vab = 230/0◦ V
                                Vbc = 230/−120◦ V
                                Vca = 230/120◦ V
 Note that Vac = −Vca = 230/−60◦ V.

                                                      We may now compute the power measured by wattmeter #1 as

                                                     SUMMARY AND REVIEW
                                                     Polyphase circuits are not encountered directly by everyone, but are part of
                                                     almost every large building installation. In this chapter we studied how three
                                                     voltages, each 120◦ out of phase with the others, can be supplied by a single
                                                     generator (and hence have the same frequency) and connected to a three-
                                                     component load. For the sake of convenience we introduced the double-
                                                     subscript notation, which is commonly employed. A three-phase system will
                                                     have at least three terminals; a neutral wire connection is not mandatory but
                                                     is common at least for the source. If a -connected load is employed, then
                                                     there is no neutral connection to it. When a neutral wire is present, we can
                                                     define phase voltages Van, Vbn, and Vcn between each phase (a, b, or c) and
                                                     neutral. Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires that these three phase voltages sum
                                                     to zero, regardless of whether positive or negative phase sequence relates
                                                     their angles. Line voltages (i.e., between phases) can be related directly to the
                                                     phase voltages; for a -connected load they are equal. In a similar fashion,
                                                     line currents and phase currents can be directly related to one another; in a
                                                     Y-connected load, they are equal. At first glance such systems can appear
                                                     to be somewhat complicated, but symmetry often allows us to perform the
                                                     analysis on a per-phase basis, simplifying our calculations considerably.

   A concise list of key concepts of the chapter is presented below for the
convenience of the reader, along with the corresponding example numbers.
❑ The majority of electricity production is in the form of three-phase
   power.
❑ Most residential electricity in North America is in the form of single-
   phase alternating current at a frequency of 60 Hz and an rms voltage of
   115 V. Elsewhere, 50 Hz at 240 V rms is most common.
❑ Double-subscript notation is commonly employed in power systems
   for both voltages and currents. (Example 12.1)
❑ Three-phase sources can be either Y- or -connected. Both types of
   sources have three terminals, one for each phase; Y-connected sources
   have a neutral connection as well. (Example 12.2)
❑ In a balanced three-phase system, each phase voltage has the same
   magnitude, but is 120◦ out of phase with the other two. (Example 12.2)
❑ Loads in a three-phase system may be either Y- or -connected.
❑   In a balanced Y-connected source with positive (“abc’’) phase
    sequence, the line voltages are
                          √                    √
                  Vab = 3Vp /30◦        Vbc = 3Vp /−90◦
                                    √
                             Vca = 3Vp /−210◦

    where the phase voltages are

          Van = Vp /0◦       Vbn = Vp /−120◦        Vcn = Vp /−240◦

    (Example 12.2)
❑   In a system with a Y-connected load, the line currents are equal to the
    phase currents. (Examples 12.3, 12.4, 12.6)
❑   In a -connected load, the line voltages are equal to the phase voltages.
    (Example 12.5)
❑   In a balanced system with positive phase sequence and a balanced
    -connected load, the line currents are
               √                       √                         √
      Ia = I AB 3/−30◦       Ib = I BC 3/−150◦          Ic = IC A 3/+90◦

    where the phase currents are

             V AB   Vab                V BC   Vbc               VC A   Vca
    I AB =        =           I BC =        =          IC A =        =
             Z     Z                 Z     Z                Z     Z

    (Example 12.5)
❑   Most power calculations are performed on a per-phase basis, assuming
    a balanced system; otherwise, nodal/mesh analysis is always a valid
    approach. (Examples 12.3, 12.4, 12.5)
❑   The power in a three-phase system (balanced or unbalanced) can be
    measured with only two wattmeters. (Example 12.7)
❑   The instantaneous power in any balanced three-phase system is constant.

      EXERCISES
      12.1 Polyphase Systems
       1. An unknown three terminal device has leads named b, c, and e. When installed
          in one particular circuit, measurements indicated that Vec = –9 V and
          Veb = –0.65 V. (a) Calculate Vcb . (b) Determine the power dissipated in the
          b-e junction if the current Ib flowing into the terminal marked b is equal to
          1 μA.
       2. A common type of transistor is known as the MESFET, which is an acronym
          for metal-semiconductor field effect transistor. It has three terminals, named
          the gate (g), the source (s), and the drain (d). As an example, consider one
          particular MESFET operating in a circuit such that Vsg = 0.2 V and
          Vds = 3 V. (a) Calculate Vgs and Vdg . (b) If a gate current Ig = 100 pA is
          found to be flowing into the gate terminal, compute the power lost at the gate-
          source junction.
       3. For a certain Y-connected three-phase source, Van = 400/33◦ V,

          INTRODUCTION
          Whenever current flows through a conductor, whether as ac or          Self-Inductance
          dc, a magnetic field is generated about that conductor. In the
          context of circuits, we often refer to the magnetic flux through a    The Dot Convention
          loop of wire. This is the average normal component of the mag-
          netic field density emanating from the loop multiplied by the         Reflected Impedance
          surface area of the loop. When a time-varying magnetic field
          generated by one loop penetrates a second loop, a voltage is          T and  Equivalent
          induced between the ends of the second wire. In order to distin-      Networks
          guish this phenomenon from the “inductance’’ we defined
          earlier, more properly termed “self-inductance,’’ we will define a    The Ideal Transformer
          new term, mutual inductance.
              There is no such device as a “mutual inductor,’’ but the          Turns Ratio of an Ideal
          principle forms the basis for an extremely important device—the       Transformer
          transformer. A transformer consists of two coils of wire separated
          by a small distance, and is commonly used to convert ac voltages      Impedance Matching
          to higher or lower values depending on the application. Every
          electrical appliance that requires dc current to operate but plugs    Voltage Level Adjustment
          into an ac wall outlet makes use of a transformer to adjust voltage
          levels prior to rectification, a function typically performed by      PSpice Analysis of Circuits

                 •
          When we defined inductance in Chap. 7, we did so by specifying the
          relationship between the terminal voltage and current,
                                              di(t)

494   CHAPTER 13 MAGNETICALLY COUPLED CIRCUITS


      where the passive sign convention is assumed. The physical basis for such
      a current-voltage characteristic rests upon two things:
      1. The production of a magnetic flux by a current, the flux being
         proportional to the current in linear inductors.
      2. The production of a voltage by the time-varying magnetic field, the
         voltage being proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic
         field or the magnetic flux.

      Coefficient of Mutual Inductance
      Mutual inductance results from a slight extension of this same argument. A
      current flowing in one coil establishes a magnetic flux about that coil and also
      about a second coil nearby. The time-varying flux surrounding the second coil
      produces a voltage across the terminals of the second coil; this voltage is pro-
      portional to the time rate of change of the current flowing through the first coil.
      Figure 13.1a shows a simple model of two coils L1 and L2, sufficiently close
      together that the flux produced by a current i1(t) flowing through L1 establishes
      an open-circuit voltage v2 (t) across the terminals of L2. Without considering
      the proper algebraic sign for the relationship at this point, we define the coef-
      ficient of mutual inductance, or simply mutual inductance, M21, as
                                                                    di 1 (t)

      The order of the subscripts on M21 indicates that a voltage response is pro-
      duced at L2 by a current source at L1. If the system is reversed, as indicated
      in Fig. 13.1b, then we have
                                                                    di 2 (t)

      Two coefficients of mutual inductance are not necessary, however; we
      will use energy relationships a little later to prove that M12 and M21 are
      equal. Thus, M12 = M21 = M. The existence of mutual coupling between
      two coils is indicated by a double-headed arrow, as shown in Fig. 13.1a and b.
         Mutual inductance is measured in henrys and, like resistance, induc-
      tance, and capacitance, is a positive quantity.1 The voltage M di/dt,
      however, may appear as either a positive or a negative quantity depending on
      whether the current is increasing or decreasing at a particular instant in time.

      (1) Mutual inductance is not universally assumed to be positive. It is particularly convenient to allow it to
      “carry its own sign’’ when three or more coils are involved and each coil interacts with each other coil. We
      will restrict our attention to the more important simple case of two coils.

Physical Basis of the Dot Convention
We can gain a more complete understanding of the dot symbolism by looking
at the physical basis for the convention; the meaning of the dots is now inter-
preted in terms of magnetic flux. Two coils are shown wound on a cylindrical
form in Fig. 13.6, and the direction of each winding is evident. Let us assume
that the current i1 is positive and increasing with time. The magnetic flux that                                             i1
i1 produces within the form has a direction which may be found by the right-
hand rule: when the right hand is wrapped around the coil with the fingers
pointing in the direction of current flow, the thumb indicates the direction of
the flux within the coil. Thus i1 produces a flux which is directed downward;                                                                i2
since i1 is increasing with time, the flux, which is proportional to i1, is also
increasing with time. Turning now to the second coil, let us also think of i2 as
positive and increasing; the application of the right-hand rule shows that i2
also produces a magnetic flux which is directed downward and is increasing.
In other words, the assumed currents i1 and i2 produce additive fluxes.
    The voltage across the terminals of any coil results from the time rate of
                                                                                                         ■ FIGURE 13.6 The physical construction of two

voltage in that coil. The sign of the self-induced voltage is known from the                               upper terminal of each coil or on the lower terminal
passive sign convention, and the sign of the mutual voltage is thus obtained.                              of each coil.
    The dot convention enables us to suppress the physical construction of the
coils by placing a dot at one terminal of each coil such that currents entering
dot-marked terminals produce additive fluxes. It is apparent that there are
always two possible locations for the dots, because both dots may always
be moved to the other ends of the coils and additive fluxes will still result.

 Identify the goal of the problem.
   We need a numerical value for V2 . We will then divide by 10/0◦ V.

 Collect the known information.
   We begin by replacing the 1 H and 100 H inductances by their corre-
   sponding impedances, j10  and j k, respectively (Fig. 13.7b). We
   also replace the 9 H mutual inductance by jωM = j90 .                                                                    (Continued on next page)

       Devise a plan.
         Mesh analysis is likely to be a good approach, as we have a circuit
         with two clearly defined meshes. Once we find I2, V2 is simply 400I2.

       Construct an appropriate set of equations.
         In the left mesh, the sign of the mutual term is determined by
         applying the dot convention. Since I2 enters the undotted terminal of
         L2, the mutual voltage across L1 must have the positive reference at
         the undotted terminal. Thus,
                              (1 + j10)I1 − j90I2 = 10/0◦
         Since I1 enters the dot-marked terminal, the mutual term in the right
         mesh has its (+) reference at the dotted terminal of the 100 H induc-
         tor. Therefore, we may write
                              (400 + j1000)I2 − j90I1 = 0

       Determine if additional information is required.
         We have two equations in two unknowns, I1 and I2. Once we solve
         for the two currents, the output voltage V2 may be obtained by
         multiplying I2 by 400 .

       Attempt a solution.
         Upon solving these two equations with a scientific calculator, we find
         that
                                  I2 = 0.172/−16.70◦ A
         Thus,

                               V2   400(0.172/−16.70◦ )
                                  =
                               V1          10/0◦
                                    = 6.880/−16.70◦

       Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
         We note that the output voltage V2 is actually larger in magnitude
         than the input voltage V1. Should we always expect this result? The
         answer is no. As we will see in later sections, the transformer can be
         constructed to achieve either a reduction or an increase in the voltage.
         We can perform a quick estimate, however, and at least find an upper
         and lower bound for our answer. If the 400  resistor is replaced with
         a short circuit, V2 = 0. If instead we replace the 400  resistor with
         an open circuit, I2 = 0 and hence
                                    V1 = (1 + jωL 1 )I1
         and
                                    V2 = jωMI1
         Solving, we find that the maximum value we could expect for
         V2 /V1 is 8.955/5.711◦ . Thus, our answer at least appears
         reasonable.
                                                                 SECTION 13.1 MUTUAL INDUCTANCE   499

    The output voltage of the circuit in Fig. 13.7a is greater in magnitude
than the input voltage, so that a voltage gain is possible with this type of
circuit. It is also interesting to consider this voltage ratio as a function of ω.
    To find I2 ( jω) for this particular circuit, we write the mesh equations in
terms of an unspecified angular frequency ω:
                       (1 + jω)I1                      − jω9I2 = 10/0◦
and
                            − jω9I1 + (400 + jω100)I2 = 0
Solving by substitution, we find that
                                              j90ω
                                I2 =
                                       400 + j500ω − 19ω2
Thus, we obtain the ratio of output voltage to input voltage as a function of
frequency ω

                           =

                              400 + j500ω − 19ω2
The magnitude of this ratio, sometimes referred to as the circuit transfer
function, is plotted in Fig. 13.8 and has a peak magnitude of approximately

                 7 near a frequency of 4.6 rad/s. However, for very small or very large fre-
                 quencies, the magnitude of the transfer function is less than unity.
                     The circuit is still passive, except for the voltage source, and the voltage
                 gain must not be mistakenly interpreted as a power gain. At ω = 10 rad/s,
                 the voltage gain is 6.88, but the ideal voltage source, having a terminal volt-
                 age of 10 V, delivers a total power of 8.07 W, of which only 5.94 W reaches
                 the 400  resistor. The ratio of the output power to the source power, which
                 we may define as the power gain, is thus 0.736.

 Once again, our first step is to replace both the mutual inductance and
 the two self-inductances with their corresponding impedances as shown
 in Fig. 13.10b. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the first mesh, a
 positive sign for the mutual term is ensured by selecting (I3 − I2 ) as the
 current through the second coil. Thus,
                   5I1 + 7 jω(I1 − I2 ) + 2 jω(I3 − I2 ) = V1
 or
                        (5 + 7 jω)I1 − 9 jωI2 + 2 jωI3 = V1                     [3]
    The second mesh requires two self-inductance terms and two mutual
 inductance terms. Paying close attention to dots, we obtain

         7 jω(I2 − I1 ) + 2 jω(I2 − I3 ) +    I2 + 6 jω(I2 − I3 )

          •
Let us now consider the energy stored in a pair of mutually coupled induc-
tors. The results will be useful in several different ways. We will first justify
our assumption that M12 = M21 , and we may then determine the maximum
possible value of the mutual inductance between two given inductors.

                                                 However, even though the value of i1 remains constant, the left-hand source
                                                 also delivers energy to the network during this time interval:

                                                 constant values is
                                                                      Wtotal = 12 L 1 I12 + 12 L 2 I22 + M12 I1 I2

                                                     Now, we may establish the same final currents in this network by allow-
                                                 ing the currents to reach their final values in the reverse order, that is, first
                                                 increasing i2 from zero to I2 and then holding i2 constant while i1 increases
                                                 from zero to I1. If the total energy stored is calculated for this experiment,
                                                 the result is found to be
                                                                      Wtotal = 12 L 1 I12 + 12 L 2 I22 + M21 I1 I2
                                                 The only difference is the interchange of the mutual inductances M21 and
                                                 M12. The initial and final conditions in the network are the same, however,
                                                 and so the two values of the stored energy must be identical. Thus,
                                                                                 M12 = M21 = M
                                                 and
                                                                        W = 12 L 1 I12 + 12 L 2 I22 + M I 1 I2                [6]

If one current enters a dot-marked terminal while the other leaves a dot-
marked terminal, the sign of the mutual energy term is reversed:
                         W = 12 L 1 I12 + 12 L 2 I22 − MI1I2                          [7]

   Although Eqs. [6] and [7] were derived by treating the final values of the
two currents as constants, these “constants’’ can have any value, and the
energy expressions correctly represent the energy stored when the instanta-
neous values of i1 and i2 are I1 and I2, respectively. In other words, lower-
case symbols might just as well be used:
           w(t) = 12 L 1 [i 1 (t)]2 + 12 L 2 [i 2 (t)]2 ± M [i 1 (t)] [i 2 (t)]       [8]

The only assumption upon which Eq. [8] is based is the logical establish-
ment of a zero-energy reference level when both currents are zero.

Establishing an Upper Limit for M
Equation [8] may now be used to establish an upper limit for the value of M.
Since w(t) represents the energy stored within a passive network, it cannot
be negative for any values of i1, i2, L1, L2, or M. Let us assume first that i1
and i2 are either both positive or both negative; their product is therefore
positive. From Eq. [8], the only case in which the energy could possibly be
negative is
                          w = 12 L 1 i 12 + 12 L 2 i 22 − Mi 1 i 2

which we may write, by completing the square, as
                 √           √       2 √
          w = 12     L 1 i 1 − L 2 i 2 + L 1 L 2 i 1 i 2 − Mi 1 i 2

   Since in reality the energy cannot be negative, the right-hand side of this
equation cannot be negative. The first term, however, may be as small as
zero, so we have the restriction that the sum of the last two terms cannot be
negative. Hence,
                                
                                  L1 L2 ≥ M

or
                                            
                                     M≤         L1 L2                                 [9]
There is, therefore, an upper limit to the possible magnitude of the mutual
inductance; it can be no larger than the geometric mean of the inductances
of the two coils between which the mutual inductance exists. Although we
have derived this inequality on the assumption that i1 and i2 carried the same
algebraic sign, a similar development is possible if the signs are opposite; it
is necessary only to select the positive sign in Eq. [8].
    We might also have demonstrated the truth of inequality [9] from a
physical consideration of the magnetic coupling; if we think of i2 as being
zero and the current i1 as establishing the magnetic flux linking both L1 and
L2, it is apparent that the flux within L2 cannot be greater than the flux within
L1, which represents the total flux. Qualitatively, then, there is an upper
limit to the magnitude of the mutual inductance possible between two given
inductors.

13.3         THE LINEAR TRANSFORMER
         •
We are now ready to apply our knowledge of magnetic coupling to the
description of two specific practical devices, each of which may be repre-
sented by a model containing mutual inductance. Both of the devices are
transformers, a term which we define as a network containing two or more
coils which are deliberately coupled magnetically (Fig. 13.15). In this sec-
tion we consider the linear transformer, which happens to be an excellent
model for devices used at radio frequencies, or higher frequencies. In
Sec. 13.4 we will consider the ideal transformer, which is an idealized
unity-coupled model of a physical transformer that has a core made of some
magnetic material, usually an iron alloy.

                                                            end of the coil, the result is a change in sign of each term involving M in

                                                            (−M), and such a change cannot affect the input impedance, as Eq. [15]
                                                            demonstrates. We also may note in Eq. [15] that the input impedance is sim-

                                                            zero, the input impedance differs from Z11 by an amount ω2 M 2 /Z22 ,

T and  Equivalent Networks
It is often convenient to replace a transformer with an equivalent network in                                  i1                 i2
the form of a T or . If we separate the primary and secondary resistances                                               M
from the transformer, only the pair of mutually coupled inductors remains,                                +                            +
as shown in Fig. 13.17. Note that the two lower terminals of the transformer                              v1        L1       L2        v2
are connected together to form a three-terminal network. We do this
because both of our equivalent networks are also three-terminal networks.                                 –                            –

    The form of these two equations is familiar and may be easily inter-
preted in terms of mesh analysis. Let us select a clockwise i1 and a counter-
clockwise i2 so that i1 and i2 are exactly identifiable with the currents in
Fig. 13.17. The terms M di 2 /dt in Eq. [16] and M di 1 /dt in Eq. [17] indi-
cate that the two meshes must then have a common self-inductance M.
Since the total inductance around the left-hand mesh is L1, a self-inductance
of L 1 − M must be inserted in the first mesh, but not in the second mesh.
Similarly, a self-inductance of L 2 − M is required in the second mesh, but
not in the first mesh. The resultant equivalent network is shown in
Fig. 13.18. The equivalence is guaranteed by the identical pairs of equations
relating v1 , i 1 , v2 , and i 2 for the two networks.

■ FIGURE 13.18 The T equivalent of the transformer shown in Fig. 13.17.



    If either of the dots on the windings of the given transformer is placed
on the opposite end of its coil, the sign of the mutual terms in Eqs. [16] and
[17] will be negative. This is analogous to replacing M with −M, and such
a replacement in the network of Fig. 13.18 leads to the correct equivalent
for this case. (The three self-inductance values would then be L 1 + M ,
−M, and L 2 + M .)
    The inductances in the T equivalent are all self-inductances; no mutual
inductance is present. It is possible that negative values of inductance may
be obtained for the equivalent circuit, but this is immaterial if our only de-
sire is a mathematical analysis. There are times when procedures for syn-
thesizing networks to provide a desired transfer function lead to circuits
containing a T network having a negative inductance; this network may
then be realized by use of an appropriate linear transformer.

    Equations [18] and [19] may be interpreted as a pair of nodal equations;
a step-current source must be installed at each node in order to provide the
proper initial conditions. The factors multiplying each integral have the
general form of inverses of certain equivalent inductances. Thus, the second
coefficient in Eq. [18], M/(L 1 L 2 − M 2 ), is 1/L B , or the reciprocal of the
inductance extending between nodes 1 and 2, as shown on the equivalent 
network, Fig. 13.21. So

No magnetic coupling is present among the inductors in the equivalent ,
and the initial currents in the three self-inductances are zero.
   We may compensate for a reversal of either dot in the given transformer
by merely changing the sign of M in the equivalent network. Also, just as
we found in the equivalent T, negative self-inductances may appear in the
equivalent  network.

                                                               two coils whose coupling is described by a mutual inductance of

                                                               The basic circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 13.24a. Note that when first

and this is the pin about which the symbol is rotated. Also note that the
K_Linear component is not “wired’’ into the schematic anywhere; its loca-
tion is arbitrary. The two coupled inductors, L1 and L2, are specified along
with the coupling coefficient through the Property Editor (Fig 13.24b).

   The circuit is connected to a 100 rad/s (15.92 Hz) sinusoidal voltage
source, a fact which is incorporated by performing a single-frequency
ac sweep. It is also necessary to add two resistors to the schematic in
order for PSpice to perform the simulation without generating an error
message. First, a small series resistance has been inserted between the
voltage source and L1; a value of 1 p was selected to minimize its
effects. Second, a 1000 M resistor (essentially infinite) was connected
to L2. The output of the simulation is a voltage magnitude of 13.33 V

                                                        PSpice also provides two different transformer models, a
                                                     linear transformer, XFRM_LINEAR, and an ideal transformer
                                                     XFRM_NONLINEAR, a circuit element which is the subject of the
                                                     following section. The linear transformer requires that values be speci-
                                                     fied for the coupling coefficient and both coil inductances. The ideal
                                                     transformer also requires a coupling coefficient, but, as we shall see, an
                                                     ideal transformer has infinite or nearly infinite inductance values. Thus,

                                                    An ideal transformer is a useful approximation of a very tightly coupled trans-
                                                    former in which the coupling coefficient is essentially unity and both the pri-
                                                    mary and secondary inductive reactances are extremely large in comparison
                                                    with the terminating impedances. These characteristics are closely approached
                                                    by most well-designed iron-core transformers over a reasonable range of fre-
                                                    quencies for a reasonable range of terminal impedances. The approximate
                                                    analysis of a circuit containing an iron-core transformer may be achieved very
                                                    simply by replacing that transformer with an ideal transformer; the ideal trans-
                                                    former may be thought of as a first-order model of an iron-core transformer.

                                                    Turns Ratio of an Ideal Transformer
                                                    One new concept arises with the ideal transformer: the turns ratio a. The
                                                    self-inductance of a coil is proportional to the square of the number of turns
                                                    of wire forming the coil. This relationship is valid only if all the flux estab-
                                                    lished by the current flowing in the coil links all the turns. In order to
                                                    develop this result quantitatively it is necessary to utilize magnetic field
                                                    concepts, a subject that is not included in our discussion of circuit analysis.
                                                    However, a qualitative argument may suffice. If a current i flows through a
                                                    coil of N turns, then N times the magnetic flux of a single-turn coil will be
                                                    produced. If we think of the N turns as being coincident, then all the flux
                                                    certainly links all the turns. As the current and flux change with time, a volt-
                                                    age is then induced in each turn which is N times larger than that caused by
                                                    a single-turn coil. Thus, the voltage induced in the N-turn coil must be N 2
                                                    times the single-turn voltage. From this, the proportionality between induc-
                                                    tance and the square of the numbers of turns arises. It follows that

                                                                                    L2  N2

                                                    is connected. The ideal nature of the transformer is established by several

conventions: the use of the vertical lines between the two coils to indicate
the iron laminations present in many iron-core transformers, the unity value
of the coupling coefficient, and the presence of the symbol 1:a, suggesting
a turns ratio of N1 to N2.
    Let us analyze this transformer in the sinusoidal steady state. The two
mesh equations are
                   V1 = jωL 1 I1 − jωMI2                                      [22]
and
                     0 = − jωMI1 + (Z L + jωL 2 )I2                           [23]
First, consider the input impedance of an ideal transformer. By solving
Eq. [23] for I2 and substituting in Eq. [22], we obtain
                                              ω2 M 2
                      V1 = I1 jωL 1 + I1
                                           Z L + jωL 2
and
                            V1              ω2 M 2
                    Zin =      = jωL 1 +
                            I1           Z L + jωL 2
Since k = 1, M 2 = L 1 L 2 so
                                             ω2 L 1 L 2
                         Zin = jωL 1 +
                                           Z L + jωL 2
    Besides a unity coupling coefficient, another characteristic of an ideal
transformer is an extremely large impedance for both the primary and sec-
ondary coils, regardless of the operating frequency. This suggests that the
ideal case would be for both L1 and L2 to tend to infinity. Their ratio, how-
ever, must remain finite, as specified by the turns ratio. Thus,
                                  L 2 = a2 L 1
leads to
                                              ω2 a 2 L 21
                      Zin = jωL 1 +
                                          Z L + jωa 2 L 1
Now if we let L1 become infinite, both of the terms on the right-hand side of
the preceding equation become infinite, and the result is indeterminate.
Thus, it is necessary to first combine these two terms:
                           jωL 1 Z L − ω2 a 2 L 21 + ω2 a 2 L 21
                   Zin =                                                      [24]
                                    Z L + jωa 2 L 1
or
                            jωL 1 Z L          ZL
                 Zin =                 =                                      [25]
                         Z L + jωa L 1
                                    2    Z L /jωL 1 + a 2
Now as L 1 → ∞, we see that Zin becomes
                                           ZL
                                   Zin =                                      [26]
                                           a2
for finite Z L .
    This result has some interesting implications, and at least one of them
appears to contradict one of the characteristics of the linear transformer.
The input impedance of an ideal transformer is proportional to the load
514   CHAPTER 13 MAGNETICALLY COUPLED CIRCUITS


      impedance, the proportionality constant being the reciprocal of the square of
      the turns ratio. In other words, if the load impedance is a capacitive imped-
      ance, then the input impedance is a capacitive impedance. In the linear trans-
      former, however, the reflected impedance suffered a sign change in its reac-
      tive part; a capacitive load led to an inductive contribution to the input
      impedance. The explanation of this occurrence is achieved by first realiz-
      ing that Z L /a 2 is not the reflected impedance, although it is often loosely
      called by that name. The true reflected impedance is infinite in the ideal
      transformer; otherwise it could not “cancel’’ the infinite impedance of the
      primary inductance. This cancellation occurs in the numerator of Eq. [24].
      The impedance Z L /a 2 represents a small term which is the amount by which
      an exact cancellation does not occur. The true reflected impedance in the
      ideal transformer does change sign in its reactive part; as the primary and
      secondary inductances become infinite, however, the effect of the infinite
      primary-coil reactance and the infinite, but negative, reflected reactance of
      the secondary coil is one of cancellation.
          The first important characteristic of the ideal transformer is therefore its
      ability to change the magnitude of an impedance, or to change impedance
      level. An ideal transformer having 100 primary turns and 10,000 secondary
      turns has a turns ratio of 10,000/100, or 100. Any impedance placed across
      the secondary then appears at the primary terminals reduced in magnitude
      by a factor of 1002, or 10,000. A 20,000  resistor looks like 2 , a 200 mH
      inductor looks like 20 μH, and a 100 pF capacitor looks like 1 μF. If the pri-
      mary and secondary windings are interchanged, then a = 0.01 and the load
      impedance is apparently increased in magnitude. In practice, this exact
      change in magnitude does not always occur, for we must remember that as
      we took the last step in our derivation and allowed L1 to become infinite in
      Eq. [25], it was necessary to neglect Z L in comparison with jωL 2 . Since L2
      can never be infinite, it is evident that the ideal transformer model will be-
      come invalid if the load impedances are very large.

      Use of Transformers for Impedance Matching
      A practical example of the use of an iron-core transformer as a device for
      changing impedance level is in the coupling of an amplifier to a speaker sys-
      tem. In order to achieve maximum power transfer, we know that the resis-
      tance of the load should be equal to the internal resistance of the source; the
      speaker usually has an impedance magnitude (often assumed to be a resis-
      tance) of only a few ohms, while an amplifier may possess an internal
      resistance of several thousand ohms. Thus, an ideal transformer is required
      in which N2 < N1 . For example, if the amplifier internal impedance is
      4000  and the speaker impedance is 8 , then we desire that
                                                ZL      8
                                Zg = 4000 = 2 = 2

                                            = 22.4

Use of Transformers for Current Adjustment
There is a simple relationship between the primary and secondary currents
I1 and I2 in an ideal transformer. From Eq. [23],
                              I2       jωM
                                 =
                              I1   Z L + jωL 2

Once again we allow L2 to become infinite, and it follows that

                          I2   jωM          L1
                             =        =
                          I1   jωL 2        L2

or
                                    I2   1
                                       =                                      [27]
                                    I1   a

Thus, the ratio of the primary and secondary currents is the turns ratio. If we
have N2 > N1 , then a > 1, and it is apparent that the larger current flows in
the winding with the smaller number of turns. In other words,
                                 N1 I1 = N2 I2
It should also be noted that the current ratio is the negative of the turns ratio
if either current is reversed or if either dot location is changed.
    In our example in which an ideal transformer was used to change the im-
pedance level to efficiently match a speaker to an amplifier, an rms current of
50 mA at 1000 Hz in the primary causes an rms current of 1.12 A at 1000 Hz
in the secondary. The power delivered to the speaker is (1.12)2(8), or 10 W,
and the power delivered to the transformer by the power amplifier is
(0.05)24000, or 10 W. The result is comforting, since the ideal transformer
contains neither an active device which can generate power nor any resistor
which can absorb power.


Use of Transformers for Voltage Level Adjustment
Since the power delivered to the ideal transformer is identical with that de-
livered to the load, whereas the primary and secondary currents are related
by the turns ratio, it should seem reasonable that the primary and secondary
voltages must also be related to the turns ratio. If we define the secondary
voltage, or load voltage, as
                                  V2 = I2 Z L

and the primary voltage as the voltage across L1, then
                                                 ZL
                             V1 = I1 Zin = I1
                                                 a2

The ratio of the two voltages then becomes
                                  V2      I2
                                     = a2

Voltage Relationship in the Time Domain
Let us now determine how the time-domain quantities v1 and v2 are related
in the ideal transformer. Returning to the circuit shown in Fig. 13.17 and the
two equations, [16] and [17], describing it, we may solve the second equa-
tion for di 2 /dt and substitute in the first equation:

                                  di 1   M       M 2 di 1
                       v1 = L 1        +    v2 −
                                  dt     L2      L 2 dt

However, for unity coupling, M 2 = L 1 L 2 , and so

The relationship between primary and secondary voltage therefore does
apply to the complete time-domain response.

                                         Superconducting Transformers
For the most part, we have neglected the various types of
losses that may be present in a particular transformer.
When dealing with large power transformers, however,
close attention must be paid to such nonidealities, de-
spite overall efficiencies of typically 97 percent or more.
Although such a high efficiency may seem nearly ideal,
it can represent a great deal of wasted energy when the
transformer is handling several thousand amperes.
So-called i2R (pronounced “eye-squared-R”) losses rep-
resent power dissipated as heat, which can increase the
temperature of the transformer coils. Wire resistance
increases with temperature, so heating only leads to
greater losses. High temperatures can also lead to
degradation of the wire insulation, resulting in shorter
transformer life. As a result, many modern power trans-
formers employ a liquid oil bath to remove excess heat
from the transformer coils. Such an approach has its
drawbacks, however, including environmental impact
and fire danger from leaking oil as a result of corrosion
over time (Fig. 13.28).
    One possible means of improving the performance of
such transformers is to make use of superconducting
wire to replace the resistive coils of a standard trans-
former design. Superconductors are materials that are
resistive at high temperature, but suddenly show no re-        ■ FIGURE 13.28 Fire that broke out in 2004 at the 340,000 V

                                           and then invoking one of the hypotheses underlying the ideal transformer:
                                           L1 must be infinite. If we assume that v1 is not infinite, then
                                                                             di 1      di 2

                                           where A is a constant of integration that does not vary with time. Thus, if we
                                           neglect any direct currents in the two windings and fix our attention only on
absolute zero, requiring expensive liquid helium–based
cryogenic cooling. With the discovery in the 1980s of ce-
ramic superconductors having critical temperatures of
90 K (−183°C) and higher, it became possible to replace
helium–based equipment with significantly cheaper
liquid nitrogen systems.
    Figure 13.29 shows a prototype partial-core super-
conducting transformer being developed at the Univer-
sity of Canterbury. This design employs environmentally
benign liquid nitrogen in place of an oil bath, and is also
significantly smaller than a comparably rated conven-
tional transformer. The result is a measurable improve-
ment in overall transformer efficiency, which translates
into operational cost savings for the owner.
    Still, all designs have disadvantages that must be
weighed against their potential advantages, and super-
conducting transformers are no exception. The most sig-
nificant obstacle at present is the relatively high cost of
fabricating superconducting wire several kilometers in
length compared to copper wire. Part of this is due to the       ■ FIGURE 13.29 Prototype 15 kVA partial core superconducting power

The minus sign arises from the placement of the dots and selection of the
current directions in Fig. 13.17.
    The same current and voltage relationships are therefore obtained in
the time domain as were obtained previously in the frequency domain, pro-
vided that dc components are ignored. The time-domain results are more
general, but they have been obtained by a less informative process.


Equivalent Circuits
The characteristics of the ideal transformer which we have established may
be utilized to simplify circuits in which ideal transformers appear. Let us as-
sume, for purposes of illustration, that everything to the left of the primary

      ■ FIGURE 13.30 The networks connected to the primary and secondary terminals
        of an ideal transformer are represented by their Thévenin equivalents.


          Thévenin’s or Norton’s theorem may be used to achieve an equivalent
      circuit that does not contain a transformer. For example, let us determine the
      Thévenin equivalent of the network to the left of the secondary terminals.
      Open-circuiting the secondary, I2 = 0 and therefore I1 = 0 (remember that
      L 1 is infinite). No voltage appears across Zg1 , and thus V1 = Vs1 and
      V2oc = aVs1 . The Thévenin impedance is obtained by setting Vs1 to zero
      and utilizing the square of the turns ratio, being careful to use the reciprocal
      turns ratio, since we are looking in at the secondary terminals. Thus,
      Zth2 = Zg1 a 2 .
          As a check on our equivalent, let us also determine the short-circuit sec-
      ondary current I2sc . With the secondary short-circuited, the primary genera-
      tor faces an impedance of Zg1 , and, thus, I1 = Vs1 /Zg1 . Therefore,
      I2sc = Vs1 /aZg1 . The ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the short-circuit
      current is a 2 Zg1 , as it should be. The Thévenin equivalent of the transformer
      and primary circuit is shown in the circuit of Fig. 13.31.

        the left of the secondary terminals in Fig. 13.30 is used to
        simplify that circuit.


          Each primary voltage may therefore be multiplied by the turns ratio,
      each primary current divided by the turns ratio, and each primary imped-
      ance multiplied by the square of the turns ratio; and then these modified
      voltages, currents, and impedances replace the given voltages, currents, and
      impedances plus the transformer. If either dot is interchanged, the equiva-
      lent may be obtained by using the negative of the turns ratio.

    Note that this equivalence, as illustrated by Fig. 13.31, is possible only
if the network connected to the two primary terminals, and that connected
to the two secondary terminals, can be replaced by their Thévenin equiva-
lents. That is, each must be a two-terminal network. For example, if we
cut the two primary leads at the transformer, the circuit must be divided into
two separate networks; there can be no element or network bridging across
the transformer between primary and secondary.
    A similar analysis of the transformer and the secondary network shows
that everything to the right of the primary terminals may be replaced by an
identical network without the transformer, each voltage being divided by a,
each current being multiplied by a, and each impedance being divided by
a2. A reversal of either winding requires the use of a turns ratio of −a.

      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      Transformers play a critical role in the power industry, allowing voltages to
      be stepped up for transmission, and stepped down to the level required for
      individual pieces of equipment. In this chapter, we studied transformers in
      the broader context of magnetically coupled circuits, where the magnetic
      flux associated with current can link two or more elements in a circuit (or
      even neighboring circuits). This is most easily understood by extending the
      concept of inductance studied in Chap. 7 to introduce the idea of mutual
      inductance (also having units of henrys). We saw that the coefficient M of
      mutual inductance is limited to less than √ the geometric mean of the two
      inductances being coupled (i.e., M ≤ L 1 L 2 ), and made use of the dot
      convention to determine the polarity of the voltage induced across one
      inductance as a result of current flowing through the other. When the two
      inductances are not particularly close, M might be rather small. However, in
      the case of a well-designed transformer, it might approach its maximum
      value. To describe such situations, we introduced the concept of the cou-
      pling coefficient k. When dealing with a linear transformer, analysis may be
      assisted by representing the element with an equivalent T (or, less com-
      monly, ) network, but a great deal of circuit analysis is performed assum-
      ing an ideal transformer. In such instances we no longer concern ourselves
      with M or k, but rather the turns ratio a. We saw that the voltages across the
      primary and secondary coils, as well as their individual currents, are related
      by this parameter. This approximation is very useful for both analysis and
      design. We concluded the chapter with a brief discussion of how Thévenin’s
      theorem can be applied to circuits with ideal transformers.
          We could continue, as the study of inductively coupled circuits is an in-
      teresting and important topic, but at this point it might be appropriate to list
      some of the key concepts we have already discussed, along with corre-
      sponding example numbers.
      ❑    Mutual inductance describes the voltage induced at the ends of a coil
           due to the magnetic field generated by a second coil. (Example 13.1)
                                                                            EXERCISES   523

❑   The dot convention allows a sign to be assigned to the mutual
    inductance term. (Example 13.1)
❑   According to the dot convention, a current entering the dotted terminal
    of one coil produces an open-circuit voltage with a positive voltage
    reference at the dotted terminal of the second coil. (Examples 13.1,
    13.2, 13.3)
❑   The total energy stored in a pair of coupled coils has three separate
    terms: the energy stored in each self-inductance ( 12 Li 2 ), and the energy
    stored in the mutual inductance (Mi 1 i 2 ). (Example 13.4)
                                                    √
❑   The coupling coefficient is given by k = M/ L 1 L 2 , and is restricted
    to values between 0 and 1. (Example 13.4)
❑   A linear transformer consists of two coupled coils: the primary
    winding and the secondary winding. (Examples 13.5, 13.6)
❑   An ideal transformer is a useful approximation for practical iron-core
    transformers. The coupling coefficient is taken to be unity, and the in-
    ductance values are assumed to be infinite. (Examples 13.7, 13.8)
❑   The turns ratio a = N2 /N1 of an ideal transformer relates the primary
    and secondary coil voltages: V2 = aV1 . (Example 13.8)
❑   The turns ratio a also relates the currents in the primary and secondary
    coils: I1 = aI2 . (Examples 13.7, 13.8)

          primary and secondary voltages of 2300 V and 230 V rms, respectively, and
          can supply 25 kVA from its secondary winding. If this transformer is supplied
          with 2300 V rms and is connected to secondary loads requiring 8 kW at unity
          PF and 15 kVA at 0.8 PF lagging, (a) what is the primary current? (b) How

          unaware that it was designed to operate on twice the supply voltage (240 VAC)
          available at American household outlets. Design a circuit to allow your friend
          to listen to the stereo in the United States, assuming the operating frequency
          (50 Hz in Germany, 60 Hz in the United States) difference can be neglected.
      58. The friend referred to in Exercise 57 attempts to justify the erroneous assump-
          tion made regarding the stereo by pointing out that the wall outlet in the W.C.
          (bathroom) had a socket for his U.S. electric razor, clearly marked 120 VAC.
          He failed to notice that the small sign below the outlet clearly stated “Razors
          only.” With the knowledge that all power lines running into the room operated
          at 240 VAC, draw the likely circuit built into the bathroom wall outlet, and
          explain why it is limited to “razors only.”

          We introduce the notion of complex frequency by considering a
          (purely real) exponentially damped sinusoidal function, such as the
          voltage

                                                                with that used in phasor-based analysis. Once we are able to find the forced
                                                                response to this damped sinusoid, we will also have found the forced

                                                                First we consider σ and ω as the real and imaginary parts of a complex
                                                                frequency.

                                                                                                 f (t) = Kest                               [6]

the factor that multiplies t in this complex exponential representation. Until
we are able to determine the complex frequency of a given function by
inspection, it is necessary to write the function in the form of Eq. [6].

The DC Case
We apply this definition first to the more familiar forcing functions. For
example, a constant voltage
                                   v(t) = V0

may be written in the form
                                v(t) = V0 e(0)t

Therefore, we conclude that the complex frequency of a dc voltage or cur-
rent is zero (i.e., s = 0).

The Exponential Case
The next simple case is the exponential function
                                 v(t) = V0 eσ t

which is already in the required form. The complex frequency of this volt-
age is therefore σ (i.e., s = σ + j0).

The Sinusoidal Case
Now let us consider a sinusoidal voltage, one that may provide a slight
surprise. Given
                           v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + θ)

we desire to find an equivalent expression in terms of the complex expo-
nential. From our past experience, we therefore use the formula we derived
from Euler’s identity,
                   cos(ωt + θ) = 12 [e j (ωt+θ) + e− j (ωt+θ) ]

and obtain

                 v(t) = 12 Vm [e j (ωt+θ) + e− j (ωt+θ) ]
                                                       
                      = 12 Vm e jθ e jωt + 12 Vm e− jθ e− jωt

or
                           v(t) = K1 es1 t + K2 es2 t

    We have the sum of two complex exponentials, and two complex                     The complex conjugate of any number can be obtained

                                                           Finally, let us determine the complex frequency or frequencies associated
                                                           with the exponentially damped sinusoidal function, Eq. [1]. We again use
                                                           Euler’s formula to obtain a complex exponential representation:
                                                                                v(t) = Vm eσ t cos(ωt + θ)
                                                                                      = 12 Vm eσ t [e j (ωt+θ) + e− j (ωt+θ) ]
                                                           and thus
                                                                           v(t) = 12 Vm e jθ e j (σ + jω)t + 12 Vm e− jθ e j (σ − jω)t
                                                           We find that a conjugate complex pair of frequencies, s1 = σ + jω
                                                           and s2 = s∗1 = σ − jω, is also required to describe the exponentially

                                                           and exponential waveforms are special cases.

                                                           A positive real value of s, e.g., s = 5 + j0, identifies an exponentially in-

                                                           physical one. A negative real value for s, such as s = −5 + j0, refers to an

                                                           is necessary to consider conjugate values of s, such as s1,2 = ± j10, with
                                                           which must be associated conjugate values of K. Loosely speaking, however,
                                                           we may identify either of the complex frequencies s1 = + j10 or s2 = − j10

                                                           the conjugate complex frequency is understood. The amplitude and phase an-
                                                           gle of the sinusoidal voltage will depend on the choice of K for each of the

  Also, ang(6 − j8) = −53.13◦ .
                                                           we obtain the real sinusoid 20 cos(10t − 53.1◦ ).
                                                               In a similar manner, a general value for s, such as 3 − j5, can be associ-

                                                           Speaking loosely again, we may think of either of these two conjugate fre-
                                                           quencies as describing an exponentially increasing sinusoidal function,

                                                           values of the conjugate complex K’s.
                                                               By now we should have achieved some appreciation of the physical na-
                                                           ture of the complex frequency s; in general, it describes an exponentially
                                                           varying sinusoid. The real part of s is associated with the exponential varia-
                                                           tion; if it is negative, the function decays as t increases; if it is positive, the
                                                           function increases; and if it is zero, the sinusoidal amplitude is constant. The
  Large magnitudes for the real part of s, the imaginary   larger the magnitude of the real part of s, the greater is the rate of exponen-
  part of s, or the magnitude of s indicate a rapidly      tial increase or decrease. The imaginary part of s describes the sinusoidal
  varying function.                                        variation; it is specifically the radian frequency. A large magnitude for the
                                                           imaginary part of s indicates a more rapidly changing function of time.

   It is customary to use the letter σ to designate the real part of s, and ω
(not jω) to designate the imaginary part:

                                   s = σ + jω                                      [7]

The radian frequency is sometimes referred to as the “real frequency,’’ but
this terminology can be very confusing when we find that we must then say
that “the real frequency is the imaginary part of the complex frequency’’!
When we need to be specific, we will call s the complex frequency, σ the
neper frequency, ω the radian frequency, and f = ω/2π the cyclic fre-
quency; when no confusion seems likely, it is permissible to use “frequency’’
to refer to any of these four quantities. The neper frequency is measured in
nepers per second, radian frequency is measured in radians per second, and
complex frequency s is measured in units which are variously termed
complex nepers per second or complex radians per second.

14.2       THE DAMPED SINUSOIDAL FORCING FUNCTION
       •
It is time to put this concept of complex frequency to work.
     The general exponentially varying sinusoid, which we may represent
with the voltage function
                          v(t) = Vm eσ t cos(ωt + θ)                               [8]

can be expressed in terms of the complex frequency s by making use of
Euler’s identity as before:
                          v(t) = Re{Vm eσ t e j (ωt+θ) }                           [9]
or
                          v(t) = Re{Vm eσ t e j (−ωt−θ) }                         [10]

Either representation is suitable, and the two expressions should remind us
that a pair of conjugate complex frequencies is associated with a sinusoid or
an exponentially damped sinusoid. Equation [9] is more directly related to
the given damped sinusoid, and we will concern ourselves principally with it.
538   CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM


      Collecting factors, we now substitute s = σ + jω into
                               v(t) = Re{Vm e jθ e(σ + jω)t }
      and obtain
                                  v(t) = Re{Vm e jθ est }                      [11]

      Before we apply a forcing function of this form to any circuit, we note the
      resemblance of this last representation of the damped sinusoid to the corre-
      sponding representation of the undamped sinusoid in Chap. 10,
                                      Re{Vm e jθ e jωt }

      The only difference is that we now have s where we previously had jω. In-
      stead of restricting ourselves to sinusoidal forcing functions and their
      radian frequencies, we have now extended our notation to include the
      damped sinusoidal forcing function at a complex frequency. It should be no
      surprise at all to see later in this section that we will develop a frequency-
      domain description of the exponentially damped sinusoid in exactly the
      same way that we did for the sinusoid; we will simply omit the Re{ } nota-
      tion and suppress est .
          We are now ready to apply the exponentially damped sinusoid, as given
      by Eq. [8], [9], [10], or [11], to an electrical network, where the forced
      response—perhaps a current in some branch of the network—is desired.
      Since the forced response has the form of the forcing function, its integral,
      and its derivatives, the response may be assumed to be

                                i(t) = Im eσ t cos(ωt + φ)
      or
                                   i(t) = Re{Im e jφ est }

      where the complex frequency of both the source and the response must be
      identical.
          If we now recall that the real part of a complex forcing function pro-
      duces the real part of the response while the imaginary part of the complex
      forcing function causes the imaginary part of the response, then we are
      again led to the application of a complex forcing function to our network.
      We will obtain a complex response whose real part is the desired real re-
      sponse. Actually, we will work with the Re{ } notation omitted, but we
      should realize that it may be reinserted at any time and that it must be rein-
      serted whenever we desire the time-domain response. Thus, given the real
      forcing function
                                  v(t) = Re{Vm e jθ est }

      we apply the complex forcing function Vm e jθ est ; the resultant forced re-
      sponse Im e jφ est is complex, and it must have as its real part the desired
      time-domain forced response
                                   i(t) = Re{Im e jφ est }

      The solution of our circuit analysis problem consists of the determination of
      the unknown response amplitude Im and phase angle φ.
                                SECTION 14.2 THE DAMPED SINUSOIDAL FORCING FUNCTION                                                             539

   Before we actually carry out the details of an analysis problem and see
how the procedure resembles what we used in sinusoidal analysis, it is
worthwhile to outline the steps of the basic method.

 1. We first characterize the circuit with a set of loop or nodal
    integrodifferential equations.
 2. The given forcing functions, in complex form, and the assumed forced
    responses, also in complex form, are substituted in the equations and
    the indicated integrations and differentiations are performed.
 3. Each term in every equation will then contain the same factor est .
    We divide throughout by this factor, or “suppress est ,’’ understanding
    that it must be reinserted if a time-domain description of any response
    function is desired.

With the Re{ } notation and the est factor gone, we have converted all the
voltages and currents from the time domain to the frequency domain. The
integrodifferential equations become algebraic equations, and their solution
is obtained just as easily as in the sinusoidal steady state. Let us illustrate the
basic method by a numerical example.



                                                                                                                    EXAMPLE 14.1

       and we substitute the given complex forcing function and the assumed
       complex forced response in this equation:

       The common factor est is next suppressed:

       and thus
                                             60/10◦
                                     I=
                                          2 + 3s + 10/s
       We now let s = −2 + j4 and solve for the complex current I:
                                          60/10◦
                          I=
                               2 + 3(−2 + j4) + 10/(−2 + j4)
       After manipulating the complex numbers, we find
                                     I = 5.37/−106.6◦
       Thus, Im is 5.37 A, φ is −106.6◦ , and the forced response can be writ-
       ten directly (recalling that s = −2 + j4) as
                           i(t) = 5.37e−2t cos(4t − 106.6◦ ) A
       We have thus solved the problem by reducing a calculus-based
       expression to an algebraic expression. This is only a small indication
       of the power of the technique we are about to study.

      14.3       DEFINITION OF THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
             •
      Our constant goal has been one of analysis: given some forcing function at
      one point in a linear circuit, determine the response at some other point. For
      the first several chapters, we played only with dc forcing functions and
      responses of the form V0 e0. However, after the introduction of inductance
      and capacitance, the sudden dc excitation of simple RL and RC circuits
      produced responses varying exponentially with time: V0 eσ t . When we
      considered the RLC circuit, the responses took on the form of the exponen-
      tially varying sinusoid, V0 eσ t cos(ωt + θ).All this work was accomplished in
      the time domain, and the dc forcing function was the only one we considered.
          As we advanced to the use of the sinusoidal forcing function, the tedium
      and complexity of solving the integrodifferential equations caused us to
                                   SECTION 14.3 DEFINITION OF THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM   541

begin casting about for an easier way to work problems. The phasor trans-
form was the result, and we might remember that we were led to it through
consideration of a complex forcing function of the form V0 e jθ e jωt . As soon
as we concluded that we did not need the factor containing t, we were left
with the phasor V0 e jθ ; we had arrived at the frequency domain.
    Now a little flexing of our cerebral cortex has caused us to apply a forcing
function of the form V0 e jθ e(σ + jω)t , leading to the invention of the complex
frequency s, and thereby relegating all our previous functional forms to
special cases: dc (s = 0), exponential (s = σ ), sinusoidal (s = jω), and ex-
ponential sinusoid (s = σ + jω). By analogy to our previous experience
with phasors, we saw that in these cases we may omit the factor containing
t, and once again obtain a solution by working in the frequency domain.


The Two-Sided Laplace Transform
We know that sinusoidal forcing functions lead to sinusoidal responses, and
also that exponential forcing functions lead to exponential responses.
However, as practicing engineers we will encounter many waveforms that
are neither sinusoidal nor exponential, such as square waves, sawtooth
waveforms, and pulses beginning at arbitrary instants of time. When such
forcing functions are applied to a linear circuit, we will see that the response
is neither similar to the form of the excitation waveform nor exponential. As
a result, we are not able to eliminate the terms containing t to form a
frequency-domain response. This is rather unfortunate, as working in the
frequency domain has proved to be rather useful.
    There is a solution, however, which makes use of a technique that allows
us to expand any function into a sum of exponential waveforms, each with
its own complex frequency. Since we are considering linear circuits, we
know that the total response of our circuit can be obtained by simply adding
the individual response to each exponential waveform. And, in dealing with
each exponential waveform, we may once again neglect any terms contain-
ing t, and work instead in the frequency domain. It unfortunately takes an
infinite number of exponential terms to accurately represent a general time
function, so that taking a brute-force approach and applying superposition
to the exponential series might be somewhat insane. Instead, we will sum
these terms by performing an integration, leading to a frequency-domain
function.
    We formalize this approach using what is known as a Laplace transform,
defined for a general function f(t) as
                                     ∞
                             F(s) =      e−st f(t) dt                       [12]
                                     −∞

The mathematical derivation of this integral operation requires an under-
standing of Fourier series and the Fourier transform, which are discussed
in Chap. 18. The fundamental concept behind the Laplace transform, how-
ever, can be understood based on our discussion of complex frequency and
our prior experience with phasors and converting back and forth between
the time domain and the frequency domain. In fact, that is precisely what
the Laplace transform does: it converts the general time-domain function
 f(t) into a corresponding frequency-domain representation, F(s).

      The Two-Sided Inverse Laplace Transform
      Equation [12] defines the two-sided, or bilateral, Laplace transform of f(t).
      The term two-sided or bilateral is used to emphasize the fact that both pos-
      itive and negative values of t are included in the range of integration. The
      inverse operation, often referred to as the inverse Laplace transform, is
      also defined as an integral expression1
                                           σ0 + j∞

                                     2π j σ0 − j∞
      where the real constant σ0 is included in the limits to ensure convergence of
      this improper integral; the two equations [12] and [13] constitute the two-
      sided Laplace transform pair. The good news is that Eq. [13] need never be
      invoked in the study of circuit analysis: there is a quick and easy alternative
      to look forward to learning.

      The One-Sided Laplace Transform
      In many of our circuit analysis problems, the forcing and response functions
      do not exist forever in time, but rather they are initiated at some specific
      instant that we usually select as t = 0. Thus, for time functions that do not
      exist for t < 0, or for those time functions whose behavior for t < 0 is of no
      interest, the time-domain description can be thought of as v(t)u(t). The defin-
      ing integral for the Laplace transform is taken with the lower limit at t = 0−
      in order to include the effect of any discontinuity at t = 0, such as an impulse
      or a higher-order singularity. The corresponding Laplace transform is then
                               ∞                      ∞
                                     −st
                      F(s) =       e f (t)u(t) dt =         e−st f (t) dt

      This defines the one-sided Laplace transform of f (t), or simply the Laplace
      transform of f (t), one-sided being understood. The inverse transform ex-
      pression remains unchanged, but when evaluated, it is understood to be
      valid only for t > 0. Here then is the definition of the Laplace transform
      pair that we will use from now on:

                                                 2π j     σ0 − j∞                                            [15]
                                      f (t) ⇔ F(s)

      The script  may also be used to indicate the direct or inverse Laplace
      transform operation:
                         F(s) = { f (t)}               and          f (t) = −1 {F(s)}

      (1) If we ignore the distracting factor of 1/2π j and view the integral as a summation over all frequencies
      such that f (t) ∝ [F(s) ds]est , this reinforces the notion that f (t) is indeed a sum of complex frequency
      terms having a magnitude proportional to F(s).

14.4      LAPLACE TRANSFORMS OF SIMPLE
       • TIME FUNCTIONS
In this section we will begin to build up a catalog of Laplace transforms for
those time functions most frequently encountered in circuit analysis; we
will assume for now that the function of interest is a voltage, although such
a choice is strictly arbitrary. We will create this catalog, at least initially, by
utilizing the definition,
                                ∞
                      V(s) =       e−st v(t) dt = {v(t)}
                                   0−

which, along with the expression for the inverse transform,
                           σ0 + j∞
                       1
              v(t) =                est V(s) ds = −1 {V(s)}
                      2π j σ0 − j∞
establishes a one-to-one correspondence between v(t) and V(s). That is, for
every v(t) for which V(s) exists, there is a unique V(s). At this point, we
may be looking with some trepidation at the rather ominous form given for
the inverse transform. Fear not! As we will see shortly, an introductory
study of Laplace transform theory does not require actual evaluation of this
integral. By going from the time domain to the frequency domain and tak-
ing advantage of the uniqueness just mentioned, we will be able to generate
a catalog of transform pairs that will already contain the corresponding time
function for nearly every transform that we wish to invert.

                                                            there is any chance that the transform may not even exist for some v(t) that

In particular, note that we obtain

                                     δ(t) ⇔ 1                                 [18]
for t0 = 0.
    An interesting feature of the unit-impulse function is known as the
sifting property. Consider the integral of the impulse function multiplied by
an arbitrary function f (t):
                              ∞
                                  f (t)δ(t − t0 ) dt
                              −∞

Since the function δ(t − t0 ) is zero everywhere except at t = t0 , the value of
this integral is simply f (t0 ). The property turns out to be very useful in sim-
plifying integral expressions containing the unit-impulse function.


The Exponential Function e−αt
Recalling our past interest in the exponential function, we examine its
transform,
                               ∞
                  −αt
              {e u(t)} =          e−αt e−st dt

                              =−         e          =
                                     s+α          0   s+α

and therefore,
                                              1
                             e−αt u(t) ⇐⇒                                     [19]
                                             s+α

It is understood that Re{s} > −α.


The Ramp Function tu(t )
As a final example, for the moment, let us consider the ramp function tu(t).
We obtain
                                  ∞
                                                   1
                      {tu(t)} =       te−st dt = 2
                                   0−             s
                                         1
                              tu(t) ⇔ 2                                [20]
                                        s

either by a straightforward integration by parts or from a table of integrals.
    So what of the function te−αt u(t)? We leave it to the reader to show that
                                               1
                            te−αt u(t) ⇔                                      [21]
                                           (s + α)2

    There are, of course, quite a few additional time functions worth con-
sidering, but it may be best if we pause for the moment to consider the
reverse of the process—the inverse Laplace transform—before returning
to add to our list.

                                                             is more work than required—if we’re willing to exploit the uniqueness of any

 Given the function G(s) = (7/s) − 31/(s + 17), obtain g(t).
 This s-domain function is composed of the sum of two terms, 7/s
 and −31/(s + 17). Through the linearity theorem we know that g(t)
 will be composed of two terms as well, each the inverse Laplace
 transform of one of the two s-domain terms:
                                           
                            −1 7         −1     31

                                 s            s + 17
 Let’s begin with the first term. The homogeneity property of the Laplace
 transform allows us to write that
                                       
                             7            1

                             s            s
 Thus, we have made use of the known transform pair u(t) ⇔ 1/s
 and the homogeneity property to find
                                    this first component of g(t). In a
                                −1    31
 similar fashion, we find that               = 31e−17t u(t). Putting
                                    s + 17
 these two terms together,
                            g(t) = [7 − 31e−17t ]u(t)

Inverse Transform Techniques for
Rational Functions
In analyzing circuits with multiple energy storage elements, we will often
encounter s-domain expressions that are ratios of s-polynomials. We thus
expect to routinely encounter expressions of the form
                                          N(s)
                                  V(s) =
                                          D(s)
where N(s) and D(s) are polynomials in s. The values of s which lead to
N(s) = 0 are referred to as zeros of V(s), and those values of s which lead
to D(s) = 0 are referred to as poles of V(s).

than that of the denominator D(s). If it is not, we must first perform a sim-
ple division step, as shown in the following example. The result will include
an impulse function (assuming the degree of the numerator is the same as
that of the denominator) and a rational function. The inverse transform of
the first is simple; the straightforward method of residues applies to the ra-
tional function if its inverse transform is not already known.

                                                  Since the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator,
                                                  F(s) is not a rational function. Thus, we begin by performing long division:

                                                  so that F(s) = 2 + (4/s). By the linearity theorem,
                                                                                            

                                                     In employing the method of residues, essentially performing a partial
                                                 fraction expansion of V(s), we focus our attention on the roots of the
                                                 denominator. Thus, it is first necessary to factor the s-polynomial that com-
                                                 prises D(s) into a product of binomial terms. The roots of D(s) may be any
                                                 combination of distinct or repeated roots, and may be real or complex. It is
                                                 worth noting, however, that complex roots always occur as conjugate pairs,
                                                 provided that the coefficients of D(s) are real.

                                                 Distinct Poles and the Method of Residues
                                                 As a specific example, let us determine the inverse Laplace transform of
                                                                                            1
                                                                            V(s) =
                                                                                     (s + α)(s + β)
                                                 The denominator has been factored into two distinct roots, −α and −β.
                                                 Although it is possible to substitute this expression in the defining equation
                                                 for the inverse transform, it is much easier to utilize the linearity theorem.
                                                 Using partial-fraction expansion, we can split the given transform into the
                                                 sum of two simpler transforms,
                                                                                       A         B
                                                                            V(s) =          +
                                                                                     s+α s+β
                                                 where A and B may be found by any of several methods. Perhaps the quick-
                                                 est solution is obtained by recognizing that
                                                                                              (s + α)

  In this equation, we use the single-fraction                                    1              1
  (i.e., nonexpanded) version of V(s).                                 = lim           −0 =
                                                                          s→−α s + β          β −α

Recognizing that the second term is always zero, in practice we would sim-
ply write
                           A = (s + α)V(s)|s=−α

Similarly,
                                                   1
                      B = (s + β)V(s)|s=−β =
                                                  α−β
and therefore,
                               1/(β − α) 1/(α − β)
                     V(s) =             +
                                 s+α       s+β
We have already evaluated inverse transforms of this form, and so
                         1                 1
               v(t) =        e−αt u(t) +        e−βt u(t)
                       β −α               α−β
                         1
                    =        (e−αt − e−βt )u(t)
                       β −α
If we wished, we could now include this as a new entry in our catalog of
Laplace pairs,
                   1                             1
                      (e−αt − e−βt )u(t) ⇔
                 β −α                      (s + α)(s + β)
    This approach is easily extended to functions whose denominators are
higher-order s-polynomials, although the operations can become somewhat
tedious. It should also be noted that we did not specify that the constants A
and B must be real. However, in situations where α and β are complex, we
will find that α and β are also complex conjugates (this is not required
mathematically, but is required for physical circuits). In such instances, we
will also find that A = B ∗ ; in other words, the coefficients will be complex
conjugates as well.


                                                                                    EXAMPLE 14.5

                                        s2 + s
 We see that P(s) is a rational function (the degree of the numerator is
 one, whereas the degree of the denominator is two), so we begin by
 factoring the denominator and write:
                                7s + 5   a   b
                      P(s) =            = +

 where our next step is to determine values for a and b. Applying the
 method of residues,

                 Repeated Poles
                 A closely related situation is that of repeated poles. Consider the function
                                                              N(s)

                                                            (s − p)n
                 which we want to expand into
                                            an         an−1               a1
                               V(s) =             +            + ··· +
                                         (s − p)n   (s − p)n−1         (s − p)
                 To determine each constant, we first multiply the nonexpanded version of
                 V(s) by (s − p)n . The constant an is found by evaluating the resulting ex-
                 pression at s = p. The remaining constants are found by differentiating the
                 expression (s − p)n V(s) the appropriate number of times prior to evaluat-
                 ing at s = p, and dividing by a factorial term. The differentiation procedure
                 removes the constants previously found, and evaluating at s = p removes
                 the remaining constants.
                     For example, an−2 is found by evaluating
                                             1 d2
                                                    [(s − p)n V(s)]s= p
                                             2! ds2
                 and the term an−k is found by evaluating
                                             1 dk
                                                    [(s − p)n V(s)]s= p
                                             k! dsk
                     To illustrate the basic procedure, let’s find the inverse Laplace transform
                 of a function having a combination of both situations: one pole at s = 0 and
                 two poles at s = −6.

                                              s + 12s2 + 36s
                  We note that the denominator can be easily factored, leading to
                                                         2              2

As promised, we see that there are indeed three poles, one at s = 0, and
two at s = −6. Next, we expand the function into

a2 ; we will find a3 using the previous procedure. Thus,

and
                                                                

The remaining constant a3 is found using the procedure for distinct poles
                                    
                               2    

                                  2              18
Thus, we may now write V(s) as
                                  − 13        1
                                            − 18    1
                                                    18
                      V(s) =            +         +
                               (s + 6)2   (s + 6)   s
   Using the linearity theorem, the inverse transform of V(s) can now
be found by simply determining the inverse transform of each term.
We see that the first term on the right is of the form
                                     K
                                 (s + α)2
and making use of Eq. [21], we find that its inverse transform is
− 13 te−6t u(t). In a similar fashion, we find that the inverse transform of
                         1 −6t                                     1
the second term is − 18    e u(t), and that of the third term is 18  u(t).
Thus,
                v(t) = − 13 te−6t u(t) − 18
                                         1 −6t       1
                                            e u(t) + 18 u(t)
or, more compactly,
                              1
                       v(t) = 18 [1 − (1 + 6t)e−6t ]u(t)

MATLAB, a very powerful numerical analysis package, can be used to
assist in the solution of equations arising from the analysis of circuits
with time-varying excitation in several different ways. The most
straightforward technique makes use of ordinary differential equation
552   CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM



       (ODE) solver routines ode23() and ode45(). These two routines are
       based on numerical methods of solving differential equations, with
       ode45() having greater accuracy. The solution is determined only at
       discrete points, however, and therefore is not known for all values of
       time. For many applications this is adequate, provided a sufficient
       density of points is used.
           The Laplace transform technique provides us with the means of
       obtaining an exact expression for the solution of differential equations,
       and as such has many advantages over the use of numerical ODE
       solution techniques. Another significant advantage to the Laplace
       transform technique will become apparent in subsequent chapters when
       we study the significance of the form of s-domain expressions,
       particularly once we factor the denominator polynomials.
           As we have already seen, lookup tables can be handy when working
       with Laplace transforms, although the method of residues can become
       somewhat tedious for functions with higher-order polynomials in their
       denominators. In these instances MATLAB can also be of assistance, as
       it contains several useful functions for the manipulation of polynomial
       expressions.
           In MATLAB, the polynomial
                       p(x) = an x n + an−1 x n−1 + · · · + a1 x + a0
       is stored as the vector [an an−1 . . . a1 a0 ]. Thus, to define the polynomi-
       als N(s) = 2 and D(s) = s3 + 12s2 + 36s we write
                                 EDU» N = [2];
                                 EDU» D = [1 12 36 0];
       The roots of either polynomial can be obtained by invoking the function
       roots(p), where p is a vector containing the coefficients of the polyno-
       mial. For example,
                                   EDU» q = [1 8 16];
                                   EDU» roots(q)
       yields
                                         ans =
                                             −4
                                             −4
       MATLAB also enables us to determine the residues of the rational
       function N(s)/D(s) using the function residue(). For example,
                             EDU» [r p y] = residue(N, D);
       returns three vectors r, p, and y, such that
                   N(s)     r1       r2             rn
                        =        +        + ··· +        + y(s)
                   D(s)   x − p1   x − p2         x − pn
       in the case of no multiple poles; in the case of n multiple poles,
                N(s)      r1      r2               rn
                     =        +         + ··· +          + y(s)
                D(s)   (x − p) (x − p)2         (x − p)n

 Note that as long as the order of the numerator polynomial is less than
 the order of the denominator polynomial, the vector y(s) will always be
 empty.

14.6     BASIC THEOREMS FOR THE LAPLACE
       • TRANSFORM
We are now able to consider two theorems that might be considered collec-
tively the raison d’être for Laplace transforms in circuit analysis—the time
differentiation and integration theorems. These will help us transform the
derivatives and integrals appearing in the time-domain circuit equations.

Time Differentiation Theorem
Let us look at time differentiation first by considering a time function v(t)
whose Laplace transform V(s) is known to exist. We want the transform of
the first derivative of v(t),
                                      ∞
                               dv               dv
                                 =        e−st    dt
                               dt      0−       dt
This can be integrated by parts:
                                                   dv
                         U = e−st           dV =      dt
                                                   dt
with the result
                                       ∞       ∞
                    dv              −st 
                         = v(t)e       − +s           e−st v(t) dt
                    dt                  0          0−

The first term on the right must approach zero as t increases without limit;
otherwise V(s) would not exist. Hence,
                         
                           dv
                               = 0 − v(0− ) + sV(s)
                           dt
and
                            dv
                               ⇔ sV(s) − v(0− )                         [23]
                            dt

                                                         Similar relationships may be developed for higher-order derivatives:
                                                                              d 2v
                                                                                   ⇔ s2 V(s) − sv(0− ) − v (0− )                    [24]
                                                                              dt 2
                                                                        d 3v
                                                                             ⇔ s3 V(s) − s2 v(0− ) − sv (0− ) − v (0− )             [25]
                                                                        dt 3
                                                         where v (0− ) is the value of the first derivative of v(t) evaluated at t = 0− ,
                                                         v (0− ) is the initial value of the second derivative of v(t), and so forth.
                                                         When all initial conditions are zero, we see that differentiating once with re-
                                                         spect to t in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by s in the fre-
                                                         quency domain; differentiating twice in the time domain corresponds to
                                                         multiplication by s2 in the frequency domain, and so on. Thus, differentia-
                                                         tion in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency do-
                                                         main. This is a substantial simplification! We also notice that, when the ini-
                                                         tial conditions are not zero, their presence is still accounted for.

                              = (0.75 + 4.25e−2t )u(t) A
 Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
   Based on our previous experience with this type of circuit, we
   expected a dc forced response plus an exponentially decaying natural
   response. At t = 0, we obtain i(0) = 5 A, as required, and as t → ∞,
   i(t) → 34 A as we would expect.
      Our solution for i(t) is therefore complete. Both the forced re-
   sponse 0.75u(t) and the natural response 4.25e−2t u(t) are present,
   and the initial condition was automatically incorporated into the                                            4⍀
   solution. The method illustrates a very painless way of obtaining the

previous expression for i(t). For t > 0,

                                           Laplace Transforms of Sinusoids
                                           To illustrate the use of both the linearity theorem and the time-differentiation
                                           theorem, not to mention the addition of a most important pair to our forth-
                                           coming Laplace transform table, let us establish the Laplace transform of
                                           sin ωt u(t). We could use the defining integral expression with integration
                                           by parts, but this is needlessly difficult. Instead, we use the relationship
                                                                                  1 jωt
                                                                    sin ωt =         (e − e− jωt )
                                                                                  2j
                                           The transform of the sum of these two terms is just the sum of the trans-
                                           forms, and each term is an exponential function for which we already have
                                           the transform. We may immediately write
                                                                         1           1      1                 ω

                                           cos ωt u(t), which is proportional to the derivative of sin ωt . That is,

                                           The Time-Shift Theorem

                                           functions begin at t = 0. What happens to the transform of a time function

                                           the transform of f (t − a)u(t − a), the original time function delayed by a
                                           seconds (and not existing for t < a)? Working directly from the definition
                                           of the Laplace transform, we get

                                           for t ≥ a − . Choosing a new variable of integration, τ = t − a, we obtain
                                                                              ∞

                                           Therefore,

                                           This result is known as the time-shift theorem, and it simply states that if a
                                           time function is delayed by a time a in the time domain, the result in the fre-

At this point we have obtained a number of entries for the catalog of Laplace
transform pairs that we agreed to construct earlier. Included are the transforms
of the impulse function, the step function, the exponential function, the ramp
function, the sine and cosine functions, and the sum of two exponentials. In
addition, we have noted the consequences in the s domain of the time-domain
operations of addition, multiplication by a constant, differentiation, and inte-
gration. These results are collected in Tables 14.1 and 14.2; several others

14.7       THE INITIAL-VALUE AND FINAL-VALUE
       • THEOREMS
The last two fundamental theorems that we will discuss are known as the
initial-value and final-value theorems. They will enable us to evaluate
 f (0+ ) and f (∞) by examining the limiting values of sF(s). Such an ability
can be invaluable; if only the initial and final values are needed for a partic-
ular function of interest, there is no need to take the time to perform an in-
verse transform operation.

The Initial-Value Theorem
To derive the initial-value theorem, we consider the Laplace transform of
the derivative once again,
                                             ∞
                   df                                 df
                        = sF(s) − f (0− ) =     e−st    dt
                    dt                        0−      dt
562   CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM


      We now let s approach infinity. By breaking the integral into two parts,
                                         +               ∞                
                                            0
                            −                   0 df              −st d f
           lim [sF(s) − f (0 )] = lim         e      dt +       e         dt
          s→∞                      s→∞     0−     dt        0+        dt
      we see that the second integral must approach zero in the limit, since the in-
      tegrand itself approaches zero. Also, f (0− ) is not a function of s, and it may
      be removed from the left limit:
                                            0+
           − f (0− ) + lim [sF(s)] = lim         d f = lim [ f (0+ ) − f (0− )]
                       s→∞              s→∞ 0−           s→∞
                                           +         −
                                    = f (0 ) − f (0 )

      and finally,
                                   f (0+ ) = lim [sF(s)]
                                             s→∞
      or
                                 lim f (t) = lim [sF(s)]                         [30]
                                 t→0+         s→∞

           This is the mathematical statement of the initial-value theorem. It states
      that the initial value of the time function f (t) can be obtained from its
      Laplace transform F(s) by first multiplying the transform by s and then let-
      ting s approach infinity. Note that the initial value of f (t) we obtain is the
      limit from the right.
           The initial-value theorem, along with the final-value theorem that we
      will consider in a moment, is useful in checking the results of a transforma-
      tion or an inverse transformation. For example, when we first calculated the
      transform of cos(ω0 t)u(t), we obtained s/(s2 + ω02 ). After noting that
       f (0+ ) = 1, we can make a partial check on the validity of this result by
      applying the initial-value theorem:
                                             s
                                  lim    s 2         =1
                                  s→∞     s + ω02
      and the check is accomplished.

      The Final-Value Theorem
      The final-value theorem is not quite as useful as the initial-value theorem,
      for it can be used only with a certain class of transforms. In order to deter-
      mine whether a transform fits into this class, the denominator of F(s) must
      be evaluated to find all values of s for which it is zero, i.e., the poles of
      F(s). Only those transforms F(s)whose poles lie entirely within the left half
      of the s plane (i.e., σ < 0), except for a simple pole at s = 0, are suitable
      for use with the final-value theorem. We again consider the Laplace trans-
      form of df/dt,
                              ∞
                                      df
                                 e−st    dt = sF(s) − f (0− )
                              0−      dt
      this time in the limit as s approaches zero,
                     ∞                                        ∞
                              df                                  df
                lim      e−st     dt = lim[sF(s) − f (0− )] =        dt
                s→0 0−        dt       s→0                     0− dt
                                 SECTION 14.7 THE INITIAL-VALUE AND FINAL-VALUE THEOREMS               563

We assume that both f (t) and its first derivative are transformable. Now,
the last term of this equation is readily expressed as a limit,
                       ∞                  t
                           df                 df
                              dt = lim           dt
                       0−  dt        t→∞   0 dt
                                            −

                                  = lim [ f (t) − f (0− )]
                                       t→∞

By recognizing that f (0− ) is a constant, a comparison of the last two equa-
tions shows us that
                              lim f (t) = lim[sF(s)]                              [31]
                             t→∞            s→0

which is the final-value theorem. In applying this theorem, it is necessary
to know that f (∞), the limit of f (t) as t becomes infinite, exists or—what
amounts to the same thing—that the poles of F(s) all lie within the left half
of the s plane except for (possibly) a simple pole at the origin. The product
sF(s) thus has all of its poles lying within the left half plane.


                                                                                           EXAMPLE 14.11
 Use the final-value theorem to determine f(∞) for the function
 (1 − e−at)u(t), where a > 0.
 Without even using the final-value theorem, we see immediately that
 f (∞) = 1. The transform of f (t) is
                                        1      1
                                F(s) =    −
                                        s     s+a
                                            a
                                      =
                                        s(s + a)
 The poles of F(s) are s = 0 and s = −a. Thus, the nonzero pole of F(s)
 lies in the left-hand s-plane, as we were assured that a > 0; we find that
 we may indeed apply the final-value theorem to this function. Multiply-
 ing by s and letting s approach zero, we obtain
                                                a
                          lim[sF(s)] = lim          =1
                          s→0             s→0 s + a

 which agrees with f (∞).
    If f (t) is a sinusoid, however, so that F(s) has poles on the jω axis,
 then a blind use of the final-value theorem might lead us to conclude
 that the final value is zero. We know, however, that the final value of
 either sin ω0 t or cos ω0 t is indeterminate. So, beware of jω-axis poles!

564   CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM


      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      The primary topic of this chapter was the Laplace transform, a mathemati-
      cal tool for converting well-behaved time-domain functions into frequency-
      domain expressions. Before introducing the transform, we first considered
      the notion of a complex frequency, which we referred to as s. This conve-
      nient term has both a real (σ ) and imaginary (ω) component, so can be writ-
      ten as s = σ + jω. In reality, this is shorthand for an exponentially damped
      sinusoid, and we noted that several common functions are actually special
      cases of this function. Limited circuit analysis can be performed with this
      generalized function, but its real purpose was to simply acquaint the reader
      with the idea of a so-called complex frequency.
           One of the most surprising things is that day-to-day circuit analysis does
      not require direct implementation of either the Laplace transform integral or
      its corresponding inverse integral! Instead, look-up tables are routinely em-
      ployed, and the s-polynomials which result from analyzing circuits in the
      s domain are factored into smaller, easily recognizable terms. This works
      because each Laplace transform pair is unique. There are several theorems
      associated with Laplace transforms which do see daily usage, however.
      These include the linearity theorem, the time-differentiation theorem, and
      the time-integration theorem. The time-shift as well as initial-value and
      final-value theorems are also commonly employed.
           The Laplace technique is not restricted to circuit analysis, or even
      electrical engineering for that matter. Any system which is described by
      integrodifferential equations can make use of the concepts studied in this
      chapter. At this stage, however, it is probably best to review the key con-
      cepts already discussed, highlighting appropriate examples.
      ❑   The concept of complex frequency allows us to consider the
          exponentially damped and oscillatory components of a function
          simultaneously. (Example 14.1)
      ❑   The complex frequency s = σ + jω is the general case; dc (s = 0),
          exponential (ω = 0), and sinusoidal (σ = 0) functions are special
          cases.
      ❑   Analyzing circuits in the s domain results in the conversion of time-
          domain integrodifferential equations into frequency-domain algebraic
          equations. (Example 14.1)
      ❑   In circuit analysis problems, we convert time-domain functions into
          the frequency
                   ∞ domain using the one-sided Laplace transform:
          F(s) = 0− e−st f (t) dt. (Example 14.2)
      ❑   The inverse Laplace transform converts frequency-domain expressions
          into the time domain. However, it is seldom needed due to the
          existence of tables listing Laplace transform pairs. (Example 14.3)
      ❑   The unit-impulse function is a common approximation to pulses with
          very narrow widths compared to circuit time constants. It is nonzero
          only at a single point, and has unity area.
      ❑   { f 1 (t) + f 2 (t)} = { f 1 (t)} + { f 2 (t)}       (additive property)
      ❑   {k f (t)} = k{ f (t)}, k = constant               (homogeneity property)
                                                                                 EXERCISES    565

❑   Inverse transforms are typically found using a combination of partial-
    fraction expansion techniques and various operations (Table 14.2) to
    simplify s-domain quantities into expressions that can be found in trans-
    form tables (such as Table 14.1). (Examples 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.10)
❑   The differentiation and integration theorems allow us to convert inte-
    grodifferential equations in the time domain into simple algebraic
    equations in the frequency domain. (Examples 14.7, 14.8, 14.9)
❑   The initial-value and final-value theorems are useful when only the
    specific values f (t = 0+ ) or f (t → ∞) are desired. (Example 14.11)

                                                            tor, we must remember that it was obtained by assuming zero initial current.
                                                            In the more general situation where energy is stored in the element at
                                                            t = 0− , this quantity is not sufficient to represent the inductor in the fre-
                                                            quency domain. Fortunately, it is possible to include the initial condition by
                                                            modeling an inductor as an impedance in combination with either a voltage
                                                            or current source. To do this, we begin by rearranging Eq. [2] as
                                                                                         V(s) = sLI(s) − Li(0− )                       [4]
                                                            The second term on the right will be a constant: the inductance L in henrys
                                                            multiplied by the initial current i(0− ) in amperes. The result is a constant
                                                                        SECTION 15.1 Z(s) AND Y(s)   573

voltage term that is subtracted from the frequency-dependent term sLI(s).
A small leap of intuition at this point leads us to the realization that we can
model a single inductor L as a two-component frequency-domain element,
as shown in Fig. 15.1b.
    The frequency-domain inductor model shown in Fig. 15.1b consists of
an impedance sL and a voltage source Li(0− ). The voltage across the
impedance sL is given by Ohm’s law as sLI(s). Since the two-element com-
bination in Fig. 15.1b is linear, every circuit analysis technique previously
explored can be brought to bear in the s-domain as well. For example, it
is possible to perform a source transformation on the model in order to
obtain an impedance sL in parallel with a current source [−Li(0− )]/sL =
−i(0− )/s. This can be verified by taking Eq. [4] and solving for I(s):
                                        V(s) + Li(0− )
                                 I(s) =
                                             sL
                                                                                              [5]
                                        V(s) i(0− )
                                      =      +
                                         sL      s
We are once again left with two terms. The first term on the right is simply an
admittance 1/sL times the voltage V(s). The second term on the right is a
current, although it has units of ampere · seconds. Thus, we can model
this equation with two separate components: an admittance 1/sL in parallel
with a current source i(0− )/s; the resulting model is shown in Fig. 15.2. The
choice of whether to use the model of Fig. 15.1b or that shown in Fig. 15.2 is
usually made depending on which one will result in simpler equations. Note
that although Fig. 15.2 shows the inductor symbol labeled with an admit-
tance Y(s) = 1/sL, it can also be viewed as an impedance Z(s) = sL; again,
the choice of which to use is generally based on personal preference.

    A brief comment on units is in order. When we take the Laplace trans-
form of a current i(t), we are integrating over time. Thus, the units of I(s)
are technically ampere·seconds; in a similar fashion, the units of V(s) are
volt·seconds. However, it is the convention to drop the seconds and assign
I(s) the units of amperes, and to measure V(s) in volts. This convention
does not present any problems until we scrutinize an equation such as
Eq. [5], and see a term like i(0− )/s seemingly in conflict with the units of
I(s) on the left-hand side. Although we will continue to measure these
phasor quantities in “amperes” and “volts,” when checking the units of an
equation to verify algebra, we must remember the seconds!

                           in the inductor through the use of a series voltage source −Li(0−).



                  We begin by first converting the circuit in Fig. 15.3a to its frequency-
                  domain equivalent, shown in Fig. 15.3b; the inductor has been replaced
                  with a two-component model: an impedance sL = 2s , and an inde-
                  pendent voltage source −Li(0− ) = −2 V.
                     We seek the quantity labeled V(s), as its inverse transform will
                  result in v(t). Note that V(s) appears across the entire inductor model,
                  and not just the impedance component.
                     Taking a straightforward route, we write

                     Before attempting to take the inverse Laplace transform of this ex-
                  pression, it is well worth a little time and effort to simplify it first. Thus,

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides results in

which can be modeled as an admittance sC in parallel with a current source
Cv(0− ) as shown in Fig. 15.5b. Performing a source transformation on this
circuit (taking care to follow the passive sign convention) results in an
equivalent model for the capacitor consisting of an impedance 1/sC in
series with a voltage source v(0− )/s, as shown in Fig. 15.5c.
    In working with these s-domain equivalents, we should be careful not to
be confused with the independent sources being used to include initial
conditions. The initial condition for an inductor is given as i(0− ); this term
may appear as part of either a voltage source or a current source, depending
on which model is chosen. The initial condition for a capacitor is given as

                            15.2 NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
                                   •
                            In Chap. 10, we learned how to transform time-domain circuits driven by
                            sinusoidal sources into their frequency-domain equivalents. The benefits of
                            this transformation were immediately evident, as we were no longer required
                            to solve integrodifferential equations. Nodal and mesh analysis of such
                            circuits (restricted to determining only the steady-state response) resulted in
                            algebraic expressions in terms of jω, ω being the frequency of the sources.
                                We have now seen that the concept of impedance can be extended to the
                            more general case of complex frequency (s = σ + jω). Once we transform
                            circuits from the time domain into the frequency domain, performing nodal
                            or mesh analysis will once again result in purely algebraic expressions, this
                            time in terms of the complex frequency s. Solution of the resulting equa-
                            tions requires the use of variable substitution, Cramer’s rule, or software
                            capable of symbolic algebra manipulation (e.g., MATLAB). In this section,
                            we present two examples of reasonable complexity so that we may examine
                            these issues in greater detail. First, however, we consider how MATLAB
                            can be used to assist us in such endeavors.



  COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
                             In Chap. 14, we saw that MATLAB can be used to determine the
                             residues of rational functions in the s-domain, making the inverse
                             Laplace transform process significantly easier. However, the software
                             package is actually much more powerful, having numerous built-in
                             routines for manipulation of algebraic expressions. In fact, as we will
                             see in this example, MATLAB is even capable of performing inverse
                             Laplace transforms directly from the rational functions we obtain
                             through circuit analysis.
                                Let’s begin by seeing how MATLAB can be used to work with alge-
                             braic expressions. These expressions are stored as character strings,
                             with the apostrophe symbol (‘) used in the defining expression. For ex-
                             ample, we previously represented the polynomial p(s) = s3 − 12s + 6
                             as a vector:
                                                      EDU» p  [1         0   −12 6];
                             However, we can also represent it symbolically:
                                                      EDU» p  ‘sˆ3 − 12*s + 6’;
                             These two representations are not equal in MATLAB; they are two
                             distinct concepts. When we wish to manipulate an algebraic expression
                             symbolically, the second representation is necessary. This ability is
                             especially useful in working with simultaneous equations.
                                Consider the set of equations
                                                                            4

Using MATLAB’s symbolic notation, we define two string variables:
         EDU» eqn1  ‘(3*s+10)*I1 − 10*I2  4/(s+2)’;
         EDU» eqn2  ‘−10*I1 + (4*s+10)*I2  −2/(s+1)’;
Note that the entire equation has been included in each string; our goal
is to solve the two equations for the variables I1 and I2. MATLAB
provides a special routine, solve(), that can manipulate the equations for
us. It is invoked by listing the separate equations (defined as strings),
followed by a list of the unknowns (also defined as strings):
             EDU» solution  solve(eqn1, eqn2, ‘I1’, ‘I2’);
The answer is stored in the variable solution, although in a somewhat
unexpected form. MATLAB returns the answer in what is termed a struc-
ture, a construct that will be familiar to C programmers. At this stage,
however, all we need to know is how to extract our answer. If we type
                         EDU» I1  solution.I1
we obtain the response
                  I1 
                  2*(4*s+9)/(s+1)/(6*sˆ2+47*s+70)
indicating that an s-polynomial expression has been assigned to the
variable I1; a similar operation is used for the variable I2.
   We can now proceed directly to determining the inverse Laplace
transform using the function ilaplace():
       EDU» i1  ilaplace(I1)
       i1 
       10/29*exp(−t)−172/667*exp(−35/6*t)−2/23*exp(−2*t)
In this manner, we can quickly obtain the solution to simultaneous
equations resulting from nodal or mesh analysis, and also obtain the
inverse Laplace transforms. The command ezplot(i1) allows us to see
what the solution looks like, if we’re so inclined. It should be noted that
complicated expressions sometimes may confuse MATLAB; in such
situations, ilaplace() may not return a useful answer.
    It is worth mentioning a few related functions, as they can also be
used to quickly check answers obtained by hand. The function numden()
converts a rational function into two separate variables: one containing
the numerator, and the other containing the denominator. For example,
                      EDU» [N,D]  numden(I1)
returns two algebraic expressions stored in N and D, respectively:
                         N
                         8*s+18
                         D
                         (s+1)*(6*sˆ2+47*s+70)
                                                        (Continued on next page)

                  In order to apply our previous experience with the function residue(),
                  we need to convert each symbolic (string) expression into a vector
                  containing the coefficients of the polynomial. This is achieved using
                  the command sym2poly():
                                                  EDU» n  sym2poly(N);
                  and
                                                  EDU» d  sym2poly(D)

                                                  6 53 117 70
                  after which we can determine the residues:
                                              EDU» [r p y]  residue(n,d)
                                              r       p          y

                  which is in agreement with what we obtained using ilaplace().


                     With these new MATLAB skills, (or a deep-seated desire to try an alter-
                 native approach such as Cramer’s rule or direct substitution), we are ready
                 to proceed to analyze a few circuits.

                  As always, our first step is to draw the appropriate frequency-domain
                  equivalent circuit. Since we have zero energy stored in the circuit at

t = 0− , we replace the 13 F capacitor with a 3/s  impedance, and the
4 H inductor with a 4s  impedance, as shown in Fig. 15.7b.
   Next, we write two mesh equations just as we have before:

                         −       + I1 + 10I1 − 10I2 = 0

                      s                  s+2

                         −       + 10I2 − 10I1 + 4sI2 = 0
                             s+1
or
                                                   2
                 −10I1 + (4s + 10)I2 =                      (mesh 2)
                                                  s+1
Solving for I1 and I2 , we find that
                                   2s(4s2 + 19s + 20)
                 I1 =                                                A

                I2 =                                                 A
                         (s + 2)(20s3 + 26s2 + 21s + 15)
All that remains is for us to take the inverse Laplace transform of each
function, after which we find that
          i 1 (t) = −96.39e−2t − 344.8e−t + 841.2e−0.15t cos 0.8529t                        We were (indirectly) told that no current flows through

and                                                                                         consequently i 2 (0+ ) must be zero as well. Does this
                                                                                            result hold true for our answer?

This circuit consists of three separate energy storage elements, none of

their corresponding impedance as shown in Fig. 15.12b. We also note
the presence of a dependent current source controlled by the nodal
voltage v2 (t).

15.3         ADDITIONAL CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
         •
Depending on the specific goal in analyzing a particular circuit, we often
find that we can simplify our task by carefully choosing our analysis
technique. For example, it is seldom desirable to apply superposition to a
circuit containing 215 independent sources, as such an approach requires
analysis of 215 separate circuits! By treating passive elements such as ca-
pacitors and inductors as impedances, however, we are free to employ any
of the circuit analysis techniques studied in Chaps. 3, 4, and 5 to circuits that
have been transformed to their s-domain equivalents.
    Thus, superposition, source transformations, Thévenin’s theorem, and
Norton’s theorem all apply in the s-domain.

                                                                                                                                         EXAMPLE 15.6
 Simplify the circuit of Fig. 15.14a using source transformations,
 and determine an expression for the voltage v(t).                                                                                    0.5 F      0.5 F

We are being asked to determine the Thévenin equivalent of the circuit
connected to the input device; this quantity is often referred to as the
input impedance of the amplifier circuit. After converting the circuit
to its frequency-domain equivalent, we replace the input device (vs and
Rs ) with a 1 A “test” source, as shown in Fig. 15.17b. The input imped-
ance Zin is then
                                                    Vin

                                                     1
or simply Vin . We must find an expression for this quantity in terms of
the 1 A source, resistors and capacitors, and/or the dependent source
parameter g.
   Writing a single nodal equation at the input, then, we find that

   however.
                                                            we see that the magnitude of this function approaches zero as s → ∞. Thus,
                                                            we say that H(s) has a zero at s = ∞. The function approaches infinity at

s = −1/RC; we therefore say that H(s) has a pole at s = −1/RC . These
frequencies are termed critical frequencies, and their early identification sim-
plifies the construction of the response curves we will develop in Sec. 15.7.

       •
The s-domain techniques we have developed up to this point are very use-
ful in determining the current and voltage response of a particular circuit.
However, in practice we are often faced with circuits to which arbitrary
sources can be connected, and require an efficient means of determining the
new output each time. This is easily accomplished if we can characterize the
basic circuit by a transfer function called the system function.
    The analysis can proceed in either the time domain or the frequency do-
main, although it is generally more useful to work in the frequency domain.
In such situations, we have a simple four-step process:



  1.   Determine the circuit system function (if not already known);
  2.   Obtain the Laplace transform of the forcing function to be applied;
  3.   Multiply this transform and the system function; and finally
  4.   Perform an inverse transform operation on the product to find the
       output.



   By these means some relatively complicated integral expressions will be
reduced to simple functions of s, and the mathematical operations of inte-
gration and differentiation will be replaced by the simpler operations of
algebraic multiplication and division.

The Impulse Response
Consider a linear electrical network N, without initial stored energy, to which
a forcing function x(t) is applied. At some point in this circuit, a response
function y(t) is present. We show this in block diagram form in Fig. 15.20a
along with sketches of generic time functions. The forcing function is shown
to exist only in the interval a < t < b. Thus, y(t) exists only for t > a.
    The question that we now wish to answer is this: “If we know the form
of x(t), how is y(t) described?” To answer this question, we need to know
something about N, such as its response when the forcing function is a unit
impulse δ(t). That is, we are assuming that we know h(t), the response
function resulting when a unit impulse is supplied as the forcing function at
t = 0, as shown in Fig. 15.20b. The function h(t) is commonly called the
unit-impulse response function, or the impulse response.
    Based on our knowledge of Laplace transforms, we can view this from
a slightly different perspective. Transforming x(t) into X(s) and y(t) into
Y(s), we define the system transfer function H(s) as

                                         Y(s)
                                H(s) ≡

      If x(t) = δ(t), then according to Table 14.1, X(s) = 1. Thus, H(s) = Y(s)
      and so in this instance h(t) = y(t).
          Instead of applying the unit impulse at time t = 0, let us now suppose
      that it is applied at time t = λ (lambda). We see that the only change in the
      output is a time delay. Thus, the output becomes h(t − λ) when the input
      is δ(t − λ), as shown in Fig. 15.20c. Next, suppose that the input impulse
      has some strength other than unity. Specifically, let the strength of the im-
      pulse be numerically equal to the value of x(t) when t = λ. This value x(λ)
      is a constant; we know that the multiplication of a single forcing function in
      a linear circuit by a constant simply causes the response to change propor-
      tionately. Thus, if the input is changed to x(λ)δ(t − λ), then the response
      becomes x(λ)h(t − λ), as shown in Fig. 15.20d.
          Now let us sum this latest input over all possible values of λ and use the
      result as a forcing function for N . Linearity decrees that the output must be
      equal to the sum of the responses resulting from the use of all possible val-
      ues of λ. Loosely speaking, the integral of the input produces the integral of
      the output, as shown in Fig. 15.20e. But what is the input now? Given the
      sifting property1 of the unit impulse, we see that the input is simply x(t), the
      original input. Thus, Fig. 15.20e may be represented as in Fig. 15.20f.
      (1) The sifting property of the impulse function, described in Section 14.5, states that
        ∞
       −∞ f (t)δ(t − t0 ) dt = f (t0 ).

The Convolution Integral
If the input to our system N is the forcing function x(t), we know the output
must be the function y(t) as depicted in Fig. 15.20a. Thus, from Fig. 15.20f
we conclude that
                                  ∞
                         y(t) =        x(λ)h(t − λ) dλ                            [9]
                                  −∞

where h(t) is the impulse response of N . This important relationship is
known far and wide as the convolution integral. In words, this last equation
states that the output is equal to the input convolved with the impulse
response. It is often abbreviated by means of
                                                                                         Be careful not to confuse this new notation with
                             y(t) = x(t) ∗ h(t)
                                                                                         multiplication!
where the asterisk is read “convolved with.”
   Equation [9] sometimes appears in a slightly different but equivalent
form. If we let z = t − λ, then dλ = −dz, and the expression for y(t)
becomes
                    −∞                                 ∞
          y(t) =         −x(t − z)h(z) dz =                x(t − z)h(z) dz
                   ∞                                  −∞

and since the symbol that we use for the variable of integration is unimpor-
tant, we can modify Eq. [9] to write

                                               ∞
                 y(t) = x(t) ∗ h(t) =              x(z)h(t − z) dz

                                       =           x(t − z)h(z) dz
                                           −∞




Convolution and Realizable Systems
The result that we have in Eq. [10] is very general; it applies to any linear
system. However, we are usually interested in physically realizable
systems, those that do exist or could exist, and such systems have a property
that modifies the convolution integral slightly. That is, the response of the
system cannot begin before the forcing function is applied. In particular,
h(t) is the response of the system resulting from the application of a unit
impulse at t = 0. Therefore, h(t) cannot exist for t < 0. It follows that, in
the second integral of Eq. [10], the integrand is zero when z < 0; in the first
integral, the integrand is zero when (t − z) is negative, or when z > t .
Therefore, for realizable systems the limits of integration change in the
convolution integrals:

         (c) h(−z) is obtained by flipping h(z) about the vertical axis, and (d ) h(t − z) results when
         h(−z) is slid t units to the right.

          It is now possible to visualize the product of the first graph, x(z),
       and the last, h(t − z), for the various ranges of t. When t is less than
       zero, there is no overlap, and
                                                 y(t) = 0       t <0
       For the case sketched in Fig. 15.24d, h(t − z) has a nonzero overlap
       with x(z) from z = 0 to z = t , and each is unity in value. Thus,
                                             t
                               y(t) =            (1 × 1) dz = t         0<t <1
                                         0

       When t lies between 1 and 2, h(t − z) has slid far enough to the right
       to bring under the step function that part of the negative square wave
       extending from z = 0 to z = t − 1. We then have
                   t−1                     t                   z=t−1    z=t

       Therefore,

       right that it lies entirely to the right of z = 0. The intersection with the

Convolution and the Laplace Transform
Convolution has applications in a wide variety of disciplines beyond linear
circuit analysis, including image processing, communications, and semi-
conductor transport theory. It is often helpful therefore to have a graphical
intuition of the basic process, even if the integral expressions of Eqs. [10]
and [11] are not always the best solution route. One powerful alternative
approach makes use of properties of the Laplace transform—hence our in-
troduction to convolution in this chapter.
    Let F1 (s) and F2 (s) be the Laplace transforms of f 1 (t) and f 2 (t), respec-
tively, and consider the Laplace transform of f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t),
                                          ∞                       

One of these time functions will typically be the forcing function that is
applied at the input terminals of a linear circuit, and the other will be the
unit-impulse response of the circuit.
    Since we are now dealing with time functions that do not exist prior to
t = 0− (the definition of the Laplace transform forces us to assume this), the
lower limit of integration can be changed to 0− . Then, using the definition
of the Laplace transform, we get

                                0−           0−

Since e−st does not depend upon λ, we can move this factor inside the
inner integral. If we do this and also reverse the order of integration, the
result is

Continuing with the same type of trickery, we note that f 1 (λ) does not
depend upon t, and so it can be moved outside the inner integral:

                 We then make the substitution x = t − λ in the bracketed integral (where
                 we may treat λ as a constant):

                 Since the remaining integral is simply F1 (s), we find that

                                           { f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t)} = F1 (s) · F2 (s)                       [12]

                     Stated slightly differently, we may conclude that the inverse transform
                 of the product of two transforms is the convolution of the individual inverse
                 transforms, a result that is sometimes useful in obtaining inverse transforms.

Further Comments on Transfer Functions
As we have noted several times before, the output vo (t) at some point in a
linear circuit can be obtained by convolving the input vi (t) with the unit-
impulse response h(t). However, we must remember that the impulse
response results from the application of a unit impulse at t = 0 with all initial
conditions zero. Under these conditions, the Laplace transform of vo (t) is
           {vo (t)} = Vo (s) = {vi (t) ∗ h(t)} = Vi (s)[{h(t)}]
Thus, the ratio Vo (s)/Vi (s) is equal to the transform of the impulse re-
sponse, which we shall denote by H(s),
                                             Vo (s)
                        {h(t)} = H(s) =                              [13]
                                             Vi (s)
From Eq. [13] we see that the impulse response and the transfer function
make up a Laplace transform pair,
                                      h(t) ⇔ H(s)
    This is an important fact that we shall explore further in Sec. 15.7, after
becoming familiar with the concept of pole-zero plots and the complex-
frequency plane. At this point, however, we are already able to exploit this
new concept of convolution for circuit analysis.

                                                    small number of elements can lead to rather unwieldy s-domain expres-

                                                    response or transfer function can provide useful insights. In this section, we

■ FIGURE 15.29 An illustration of the physical meaning of positive and negative values for σ and ω,
  as would be represented on the complex-frequency plane. When ω = 0, a function will have no
  oscillatory component; when σ = 0, the function is purely sinusoidal except when ω is also zero.


    To construct an appropriate three-dimensional representation of some
function F(s), we first note that we have its magnitude in mind, although the
phase will have a strong complex-frequency dependence as well and may
be graphed in a similar fashion. Thus, we will begin by substituting σ + jω
for s in our function F(s), then proceed to determine an expression for
|F(s)|. We next draw an axis perpendicular to the s plane, and use this to
plot |F(s)| for each value of σ and ω. The basic process is illustrated in the
following example.

                                                                                                          EXAMPLE 15.11

                                                   s+3
  Substituting s = σ + jω, we find the magnitude of the function is

the floor and then imagine a large elastic sheet laid on it. We now fix our
attention on all the poles and zeros of the response. At each zero, the re-
sponse is zero, the height of the sheet must be zero, and we therefore tack
the sheet to the floor. At the value of s corresponding to each pole, we may
prop up the sheet with a thin vertical rod. Zeros and poles at infinity must be
treated by using a large-radius clamping ring or a high circular fence, re-
spectively. If we have used an infinitely large, weightless, perfectly elastic
sheet, tacked down with vanishingly small tacks, and propped up with infi-
nitely long, zero-diameter rods, then the elastic sheet assumes a height that
is exactly proportional to the magnitude of the response.
     These comments may be illustrated by considering the configuration of
the poles and zeros, sometimes called a pole-zero constellation, that locates
all the critical frequencies of a frequency-domain quantity, for example, an
impedance Z(s). A pole-zero constellation for an example impedance is
shown in Fig. 15.32; in such a diagram, poles are denoted by crosses and
zeros by circles. If we visualize an elastic-sheet model, tacked down at
s = −2 + j0 and propped up at s = −1 + j5 and at s = −1 − j5, we
should see a terrain whose distinguishing features are two mountains and
one conical crater or depression. The portion of the model for the upper
LHP is shown in Fig. 15.32b.

   Let us now build up the expression for Z(s) that leads to this pole-zero
configuration. The zero requires a factor of (s + 2) in the numerator, and
the two poles require the factors (s + 1 − j5) and (s + 1 + j5) in the
denominator. Except for a multiplying constant k, we now know the form
of Z(s):

    In order to determine k, we require a value for Z(s) at some s other than
a critical frequency. For this function, let us suppose we are told Z(0)  1.

                                                            domain through the Laplace transform allows us to consider a broad

                                                            working algebraically instead. This approach is very powerful, but it
                                                            does suffer from not being a very visual process. In contrast, there is
                                                            a tremendous amount of information contained in the pole-zero plot of a

                                                            to obtain the complete response of a circuit—natural plus forced—provided

    Next we consider the natural response. From previous experience, we
know that the form will be a decaying exponential with the time constant
L/R, but let’s pretend that we are finding it for the first time. The form of
the natural (source-free) response is, by definition, independent of the forc-
ing function; the forcing function contributes only to the magnitude of the
natural response. To find the proper form, we turn off all independent
sources; here, vs (t) is replaced by a short circuit. Next, we try to obtain the
natural response as a limiting case of the forced response. Returning to the
frequency-domain expression of Eq. [16], we obediently set Vs = 0. On
the surface, it appears that I(s) must also be zero, but this is not necessarily
true if we are operating at a complex frequency that is a simple pole of I(s).
That is, the denominator and the numerator may both be zero so that I(s)
need not be zero.
    Let us inspect this new idea from a slightly different vantage point. We
fix our attention on the ratio of the desired forced response to the forcing
function. We designate this ratio H(s) and define it to be the circuit transfer         What does it mean to “operate” at a complex
function. Then,                                                                         frequency? How could we possibly accomplish such a

In this example, the transfer function is the input admittance faced by Vs .            function e σ t . Such types of signals are very easy to
We seek the natural (source-free) response by setting Vs = 0. However,                  generate with real (i.e., nonimaginary) laboratory equip-

tion therefore assume a special significance.
     In this particular example, we see that the pole of the transfer function
occurs at s = −R/L + j0, as shown in Fig. 15.34. If we choose to operate
at this particular complex frequency, the only finite current that could result
must be a constant in the s-domain (i.e., frequency-independent). We thus
obtain the natural response

response to the time domain. Our knee-jerk reaction might be to attempt
to apply inverse Laplace transform techniques in this situation. However,
we have already specified a value of s, so that such an approach is not                                            j

      circuit. The forced response i f (t) is obtained by finding the inverse Laplace
      transform of I f (s).


      A More General Perspective
      Figure 15.35 shows single sources connected to networks containing no
      independent sources. The desired response, which might be some current
      I1 (s) or some voltage V2 (s), may be expressed by a transfer function that
      displays all the critical frequencies. To be specific, we select the response
      V2 (s) in Fig. 15.35a:

                                  V2 (s)            (s − s1 )(s − s3 ) · · ·
                                         = H(s) = k                                                           [17]
                                   Vs               (s − s2 )(s − s4 ) · · ·

      The poles of H(s) occur at s = s2 , s4 , . . . , and so a finite voltage V2 (s) at
      each of these frequencies must be a possible functional form for the natural
      response. Thus, we think of a zero-volt source (which is just a short-circuit)
      applied to the input terminals; the natural response that occurs when the
      input terminals are short-circuited must therefore have the form

                                       v2n (t) = A2 es2 t + A4 es4 t + · · ·

      where each A must be evaluated in terms of the initial conditions (including
      the initial value of any voltage source applied at the input terminals).
            To find the form of the natural response i 1n (t) in Fig. 15.35a, we should
      determine the poles of the transfer function, H(s) = I1 (s)/Vs . The transfer
      functions applying to the situations depicted in Fig. 15.35b would be
      I1 (s)/Is and V2 (s)/Is , and their poles then determine the natural responses
      i 1n (t) and v2n (t), respectively.
            If the natural response is desired for a network that does not contain any
      independent sources, then a source Vs or Is may be inserted at any conve-
      nient point, restricted only by the condition that the original network is
      obtained when the source is set to zero. The corresponding transfer function
      is then determined and its poles specify the natural frequencies. Note that
      the same frequencies must be obtained for any of the many source locations
      possible. If the network already contains a source, that source may be set
      equal to zero and another source inserted at a more convenient point.

A Special Case
Before we illustrate this method with an example, completeness requires us
to acknowledge a special case that might arise. This occurs when the net-
work in Fig. 15.35a or b contains two or more parts that are isolated from
each other. For example, we might have the parallel combination of three
networks: R1 in series with C, R2 in series with L, and a short circuit.
Clearly, a voltage source in series with R1 and C cannot produce any current
in R2 and L; that transfer function would be zero. To find the form of the nat-
ural response of the inductor voltage, for example, the voltage source must
be installed in the R2 L network. A case of this type can often be recognized
by an inspection of the network before a source is installed; but if it is not,
then a transfer function equal to zero will be obtained. When H(s) = 0, we
obtain no information about the frequencies characterizing the natural
response, and a more suitable location for the source must be used.


                                                                                                                EXAMPLE 15.12

 transfer function H(s) = I1 (s)/Vs , which also happens to be the input

    From recent experience, we know at a glance that i 1 must be of the
 form
                            i 1 (t) = Ae−2t + Be−t/6
 The solution is completed by using the given initial conditions to estab-
 lish the values of A and B. Since i 1 (0) is given as 11 amperes,
                                  11 = A + B
 The necessary additional equation is obtained by writing the KVL

       Thus, A = 8 and B = 3, and so the desired solution is
                            i 1 (t) = 8e−2t + 3e−t/6            amperes
       The natural frequencies constituting i 2 are the same as those of i 1 , and a

           The process that we must pursue to evaluate the amplitude coefficients
      of the natural response is a detailed one, except in those cases where the ini-
      tial values of the desired response and its derivatives are obvious. However,
      we should not lose sight of the ease and rapidity with which the form of the
      natural response can be obtained.

                                    out /Vin
      Much of the discussion in this chapter has been related to the poles and
      zeros of a transfer function. We have located them on the complex-
      frequency plane, we have used them to express transfer functions as ratios
      of factors or polynomials in s, we have calculated forced responses from
      them, and in Sec. 15.7 we have used their poles to establish the form of the
      natural response.
          Now let us see how we might determine a network that can provide a
      desired transfer function. We consider only a small part of the general prob-
      lem, working with a transfer function of the form H(s) = Vout (s)/Vin (s), as
      indicated in Fig. 15.41. For simplicity, we restrict H(s) to critical frequen-
      cies on the negative σ axis (including the origin). Thus, we will consider
      transfer functions such as

If Z f and Z1 are both resistances, the circuit acts as an inverting amplifier,                                               Rf

The only finite critical frequency is a zero at s = −1/R1 C1 .
    For our ideal op amps, the output or Thévenin impedance is zero and
therefore Vout and Vout /Vin are not functions of any load Z L that may be
placed across the output terminals. This includes the input to another op
amp as well, and therefore we may connect circuits having poles and zeros
at specified locations in cascade, where the output of one op amp is
connected directly to the input of the next, and thus generates any desired
transfer function.

      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      After having been exposed to the concept of complex frequency in
      Chap. 14, we applied that concept to circuit analysis in this chapter. The
      first topic was impedance—perhaps familiar to those who have already
      read Chap. 10. The concept of impedance (or admittance) allows us to
      directly construct s-domain equations which describe nodal voltages, mesh
      currents, etc., without having to rely on taking the Laplace transform of
      each term of an integrodifferential equation. Somewhat surprisingly, we
      found that the impedance of inductors and capacitors includes the initial
      condition of that element. From that point forward, all of our familiar
      circuit analysis techniques apply. The only difficulty encountered is in fac-
      toring higher-order polynomials in order to perform an inverse transform.
      We also introduced the notion of a system transfer function, which allows
      the input to a network to be changed easily, and the new output predicted.
      Working in the s-domain proved very natural here, and we saw that convo-
      lution of two time-domain functions is easily performed by multiplying
      their s-domain equivalents.
                                                            SUMMARY AND REVIEW                                                 611

    The third major topic of the chapter was the complex-frequency plane,
which allows us to create a graphical representation of any s-domain ex-
pression. In particular, it provides a tidy means for readily identifying poles
and zeros. Since the sources connected to a circuit only determine the mag-
nitude of the transient response, and not the form of the transisent response
itself, we found that s-domain analysis can reveal details about the natural
as well as forced response of a network. We concluded the chapter with a
description of how op amps can be employed to synthesize a desired trans-
fer function, placing poles and zeros where they are needed through cas-
caded stages.
    This topic will be revisited in future studies of signal analysis, and the
concept of convolution in particular is applicable to a broad range of appli-
cations. At this stage, however, perhaps we should pause and allow the
reader to focus on key issues and identify relevant examples as a start to re-
viewing what we have discussed.
❑   Resistors may be represented in the frequency domain by an
    impedance having the same magnitude. (Example 15.1)
❑   Inductors may be represented in the frequency domain by an                    These models are summarized in Table 15.1.
    impedance sL. If the initial current is nonzero, then the impedance
    must be placed in series with a voltage source −Li(0− ) or in parallel
    with a current source i(0− )/s. (Example 15.1)
❑   Capacitors may be represented in the frequency domain by an
    impedance 1/sC . If the initial voltage is nonzero, then the impedance
    must be placed in series with a voltage source v(0− )/s or in parallel
    with a current source Cv(0− ). (Example 15.2)
❑   Nodal and mesh analysis in the s-domain lead to simultaneous
    equations in terms of s-polynomials. MATLAB is a particularly useful
    tool for solving such systems of equations. (Examples 15.3, 15.4, 15.5)
❑   Superposition, source transformation, and the Thévenin and Norton
    theorems all apply in the s-domain. (Examples 15.6, 15.7)
❑   A circuit transfer function H(s) is defined as the ratio of the s-domain
    output to the s-domain input. Either quantity may be a voltage or
    current. (Example 15.8)
❑   The zeros of H(s) are those values that result in zero magnitude. The
    poles of H(s) are those values that result in infinite magnitude.
❑   Convolution provides us with both an analytic and a graphical means
    of determining the output of a circuit from its impulse response h(t).
    (Examples 15.8, 15.9, 15.10)
❑   There are several graphical approaches to representing s-domain
    expressions in terms of poles and zeros. Such plots can be used to
    synthesize a circuit to obtain a desired response. (Example 15.11)
❑   A source-free circuit can be analyzed using s-domain techniques to
    determine its transient response.
❑   Single op amp stages can be used to synthesize transfer functions
    having either a zero or a pole. More complex functions can be
    synthesized by cascading multiple stages.

          We have already been introduced to the concept of frequency              and Capacitors
          response, meaning that the behavior of our circuit can change
          dramatically depending on the frequency (or frequencies) of              Quality Factor
          operation—a radical departure from our first experiences with
          simple dc circuits. In this chapter we take the topic to a more re-      Bandwidth
          fined level, as even simple circuits designed for specific frequency
          response can be enormously useful in a wide variety of everyday          Frequency and Magnitude
          applications. In fact, we make use of frequency-selective circuits       Scaling
          throughout the day, probably without even realizing it. For exam-
          ple, switching to our favorite radio station is in fact tuning our       Bode Diagram Techniques
          radio to selectively amplify a narrow band of signal frequencies;
          heating microwave popcorn is possible while watching television          Low- and High-Pass Filters
          or talking on a cell phone because the frequencies of each device
          can be isolated from one another. In addition, studying frequency        Bandpass Filter Design
          response and filters can be particularly enjoyable as it provides us
          with a vehicle for pushing past analysis of existing circuits, and       Active Filters
          enabling the design of complex circuits from scratch to meet some-
          times stringent specifications. We’ll start this journey with a short    Butterworth Filter Design
          discussion of resonance, loss, quality factor, and bandwidth—
          important concepts for filters as well as any circuit (or system, for
          that matter) containing energy storage elements.

          Suppose that a certain forcing function is found to contain sinusoidal
          components having frequencies within the range of 10 to 100 Hz. Now
          let us imagine that this forcing function is applied to a network that

      has the property that all sinusoidal voltages with frequencies from zero to
      200 Hz applied at the input terminals appear doubled in magnitude at the
      output terminals, with no change in phase angle. The output function is
      therefore an undistorted facsimile of the input function, but with twice the
      amplitude. If, however, the network has a frequency response such that the
      magnitudes of input sinusoids between 10 and 50 Hz are multiplied by a dif-
      ferent factor than are those between 50 and 100 Hz, then the output would
      in general be distorted; it would no longer be a magnified version of the in-
      put. This distorted output might be desirable in some cases and undesirable
      in others. That is, the network frequency response might be chosen deliber-
      ately to reject some frequency components of the forcing function, or to
      emphasize others.
           Such behavior is characteristic of tuned circuits or resonant circuits, as
      we will see in this chapter. In discussing resonance we will be able to apply
      all the methods we have discussed in presenting frequency response.

      Resonance
      In this section we will begin the study of a very important phenomenon that
      may occur in circuits that contain both inductors and capacitors. The phe-
      nomenon is called resonance, and it may be loosely described as the condi-
      tion existing in any physical system when a fixed-amplitude sinusoidal
      forcing function produces a response of maximum amplitude. However, we
      often speak of resonance as occurring even when the forcing function is not
      sinusoidal. The resonant system may be electrical, mechanical, hydraulic,
      acoustic, or some other kind, but we will restrict our attention, for the most
      part, to electrical systems.
          Resonance is a familiar phenomenon. Jumping up and down on the
      bumper of an automobile, for example, can put the vehicle into rather large
      oscillatory motion if the jumping is done at the proper frequency (about one
      jump per second), and if the shock absorbers are somewhat decrepit. How-
      ever, if the jumping frequency is increased or decreased, the vibrational
      response of the automobile will be considerably less than it was before. A
      further illustration is furnished in the case of an opera singer who is able to
      shatter crystal goblets by means of a well-formed note at the proper fre-
      quency. In each of these examples, we are thinking of frequency as being
      adjusted until resonance occurs; it is also possible to adjust the size, shape,
      and material of the mechanical object being vibrated, but this may not be so
      easily accomplished physically.
          The condition of resonance may or may not be desirable, depending
      upon the purpose which the physical system is to serve. In the automotive
      example, a large amplitude of vibration may help to separate locked
      bumpers, but it would be somewhat disagreeable at 65 mi/h (105 km/h).
          Let us now define resonance more carefully. In a two-terminal electrical
      network containing at least one inductor and one capacitor, we define reso-
      nance as the condition which exists when the input impedance of the net-
      work is purely resistive. Thus,

         a network is in resonance (or resonant) when the voltage and current
         at the network input terminals are in phase.

We will also find that a maximum-amplitude response is produced in the
                                                                                                               ILC          IL     +      IC

    We first apply the definition of resonance to a parallel RLC network dri-         I              R               L             V       C

    Resonance occurs when the voltage and current at the input terminals
are in phase. This corresponds to a purely real admittance, so that the nec-
essary condition is given by

devote our attention to the case for which ω is the variable. Hence, the res-
onant frequency ω0 is

curve, are also identified. Let us first show that the maximum impedance
magnitude is R and that this maximum occurs at resonance.
    The admittance, as specified by Eq. [1], possesses a constant conduc-
tance and a susceptance which has a minimum magnitude (zero) at reso-
nance. The minimum admittance magnitude therefore occurs at resonance,
and it is 1/R. Hence, the maximum impedance magnitude is R, and it
occurs at resonance.
    At the resonant frequency, therefore, the voltage across the parallel reso-
nant circuit of Fig. 16.1 is simply IR, and the entire source current I flows
through the resistor. However, current is also present in L and C. For the
inductor, I L ,0 = V L ,0 /jω0 L = IR/jω0 L, and the capacitor current at reso-
nance is IC,0 = ( jω0 C)VC,0 = jω0 CRI. Since 1/ω0 C = ω0 L at resonance,
we find that
                          IC,0 = −I L ,0 = jω0 CRI                           [5]
and
                           IC,0 + I L ,0 = I LC = 0

Thus, the net current flowing into the LC combination is zero. The maxi-
mum value of the response magnitude and the frequency at which it occurs
are not always found so easily. In less standard resonant circuits, we may
find it necessary to express the magnitude of the response in analytical
form, usually as the square root of the sum of the real part squared and the
imaginary part squared; then we should differentiate this expression with
respect to frequency, equate the derivative to zero, solve for the frequency
of maximum response, and finally substitute this frequency in the magni-
tude expression to obtain the maximum-amplitude response. The procedure
may be carried out for this simple case merely as a corroborative exercise;
but, as we have seen, it is not necessary.


Quality Factor
It should be emphasized that, although the height of the response curve of
Fig. 16.3 depends only upon the value of R for constant-amplitude excita-
tion, the width of the curve or the steepness of the sides depends upon the
other two element values also. We will shortly relate the “width of the             We should be very careful not to confuse the quality

the quality factor Q.
    We will find that the sharpness of the response curve of any resonant cir-
cuit is determined by the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in
the circuit, compared with the energy that is lost during one complete period
of the response.
    We define Q as

                                       maximum energy stored
           Q = quality factor ≡ 2π                                           [6]
                                      total energy lost per period

The proportionality constant 2π is included in the definition in order to sim-
plify the more useful expressions for Q which we will now obtain. Since
624   CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE


      energy can be stored only in the inductor and the capacitor, and can be lost
      only in the resistor, we may express Q in terms of the instantaneous energy
      associated with each of the reactive elements and the average power PR
      dissipated in the resistor:
                                          [w L (t) + wC (t)]max
                              Q = 2π
                                                   PR T

      where T is the period of the sinusoidal frequency at which Q is evaluated.
         Now let us apply this definition to the parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 16.1
      and determine the value of Q at the resonant frequency; this value of Q is
      denoted by Q 0 . We select the current forcing function
                                       i(t) = Im cos ω0 t
      and obtain the corresponding voltage response at resonance,
                              v(t) = Ri(t) = RIm cos ω0 t

      so that
                                            I2m R 2 C
                                w L (t) =             sin2 ω0 t
                                                2
      The total instantaneous stored energy is therefore constant:
                                                        I2m R 2 C
                           w(t) = w L (t) + wC (t) =
                                                            2
      and this constant value must also be the maximum value. In order to find the
      energy lost in the resistor in one period, we take the average power absorbed
      by the resistor (see Sec. 11.2),
                                         PR = 12 I2m R
      and multiply by one period, obtaining
                                                 1 2
                                       PR T =       I R
                                                2 f0 m
      We thus find the quality factor at resonance:
                                              I2 R 2 C/2
                                      Q 0 = 2π m2
                                               Im R/2 f 0
      or
                                Q 0 = 2π f 0 RC = ω0 RC                         [7]
      This equation (as well as any expression in Eq. [8]) holds only for the sim-
      ple parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 16.1. Equivalent expressions for Q 0 which

are often quite useful may be obtained by simple substitution:
                             
                               C        R         R

                                L    |X C,0 |   |X L ,0 |
    So we see that for this specific circuit, decreasing the resistance de-
creases Q 0 ; the lower the resistance, the greater the amount of energy lost
in the element. Intriguingly, increasing the capacitance increases Q 0 , but
increasing the inductance leads to a reduction in Q 0 . These statements, of
course, apply to operation of the circuit at the resonant frequency.

Other Interpretations of Q
Another useful interpretation of Q is obtained when we inspect the inductor
and capacitor currents at resonance, as given by Eq. [5],
                     IC,0 = −I L ,0 = jω0 CRI = jQ 0 I                          [9]
Note that each is Q 0 times the source current in amplitude and that each is
180◦ out of phase with the other. Thus, if we apply 2 mA at the resonant fre-
quency to a parallel resonant circuit with a Q 0 of 50, we find 2 mA in the
resistor, and 100 mA in both the inductor and the capacitor. A parallel reso-
nant circuit can therefore act as a current amplifier, but not, of course, as a
power amplifier, since it is a passive network.
    Resonance, by definition, is fundamentally associated with the forced
response, since it is defined in terms of a (purely resistive) input impedance,
a sinusoidal steady-state concept. The two most important parameters of a
resonant circuit are perhaps the resonant frequency ω0 and the quality fac-
tor Q 0 . Both the exponential damping coefficient and the natural resonant
frequency may be expressed in terms of ω0 and Q 0 :

Damping Factor
For future reference it may be helpful to note one additional relationship
involving ω0 and Q 0 . The quadratic factor appearing in the numerator of
Eq. [4],

                 may be written in terms of α and ω0 :
                                                  s2 + 2αs + ω02
                 In the field of system theory or automatic control theory, it is traditional to
                 write this factor in a slightly different form that utilizes the dimensionless
                 parameter ζ (zeta), called the damping factor:
                                                 s2 + 2ζ ω0 s + ω02
                 Comparison of these expressions allows us to relate ζ to other parameters:

  EXAMPLE 16.1
                  Consider a parallel RLC circuit such that L  2 mH, Q0  5, and
                  C  10 nF. Determine the value of R and the magnitude of the
                  steady-state admittance at 0.1ω0, ω0, and 1.1ω0.
                  We derived several expressions for Q 0 , a parameter directly related to
                  energy loss, and hence the resistance in our circuit. Rearranging the
                  expression in Eq. [8], we calculate
                                                  

                  Next, we compute ω0 , a term we may recall from Chap. 9,

                  or, alternatively, we may exploit Eq. [7] and obtain the same answer,

                  The admittance of any parallel RLC network is simply
                                               1             1

                                               R           jωL
                  and hence
                                                1             1
                                        |Y| = + jωC +
                                               R            jωL
                  evaluated at the three designated frequencies is equal to
                       |Y(0.9ω0 )| = 6.504 × 10−4 S           |Y(ω0 )| = 4.472 × 10−4 S
                                        |Y(1.1ω0 )| = 6.182 × 10−4 S
                  We thus obtain a minimum impedance at the resonant frequency, or a
                  maximum voltage response to a particular input current. If we quickly
                  compute the reactance at these three frequencies, we find
                        X (0.9ω0 ) = −4.72 × 10−4 S          X (1.1ω0 ) = 4.72 × 10−4 S
                                           X (ω0 ) = −1.36 × 10−7
                  We leave it to the reader to show that our value for X (ω0 ) is nonzero
                  only as a result of rounding error.

    Now let us interpret Q 0 in terms of the pole-zero locations of the ad-
mittance Y(s) of the parallel RLC circuit. We will keep ω0 constant; this
may be done, for example, by changing R while holding L and C con-
stant. As Q 0 is increased, the relationships relating α, Q 0 , and ω0 indicate
that the two zeros must move closer to the jω axis. These relationships
also show that the zeros must simultaneously move away from the σ axis.                                           Q0 = ∞ j␻
The exact nature of the movement becomes clearer when we remember                                                 R =∞
that the point at which s = jω0 could be located on the jω axis by swing-                                                       j␻0

positive jω axis; since ω0 is to be held constant, the radius must be con-
stant, and the zeros must therefore move along this arc toward the positive
                                                                                       Q0 = 1                          ␻0             Y(s)

                                                                                            2   C

zeros are found at s = ± jω0 on the jω axis. As R decreases, the zeros                              –␻0          –␣
move toward the σ axis along the circular locus,

zero on the σ axis at s = −ω0 when R = 12 L/C or Q 0 = 12 . This condi-
tion may be recalled as that for critical damping, so that ωd = 0 and                                                  ␻0

arate and move in opposite directions on the negative σ axis, but these low

values of Q 0 are not really typical of resonant circuits and we need not track

16.2 BANDWIDTH AND HIGH-Q CIRCUITS
      •
We continue our discussion of parallel resonance by defining half-power
frequencies and bandwidth, and then we will make good use of these new
concepts in obtaining approximate response data for high-Q circuits. The
“width” of a resonance response curve, such as the one shown in Fig. 16.3,
may now be defined more carefully and related to Q 0 . Let us first define the
two half-power frequencies ω1 and ω2 as those frequencies at which the
magnitude of the input admittance of a parallel
                                              √ resonant circuit is greater
than the magnitude at resonance by a factor of 2. Since the response curve

  These names arise from the fact that a voltage which is   of Fig. 16.3 displays the voltage produced across the parallel circuit by a
  1/ 2 times the resonant voltage is equivalent to a        sinusoidal current source as a function of frequency, the half-power √ fre-
  squared voltage which is one-half the squared voltage     quencies also locate those points at which the voltage response is 1/ 2, or
  at resonance. Thus, at the half-power frequencies, the    0.707, times its maximum value. A similar relationship holds for the imped-
  resistor absorbs one-half the power that it does at       ance magnitude. We will designate ω1 as the lower half-power frequency
  resonance.                                                and ω2 as the upper half-power frequency.

                                                            The (half-power) bandwidth of a resonant circuit is defined as the differ-
                                                            ence of these two half-power frequencies.

Approximations for High-Q Circuits
Many resonant circuits are deliberately designed to have a large Q 0 in order                                         s plane
to take advantage of the narrow bandwidth and high frequency selectivity                                               Y(s)
associated with such circuits. When Q 0 is larger than about 5, it is possible
to make some useful approximations in the expressions for the upper and
lower half-power frequencies and in the general expressions for the re-
sponse in the neighborhood of resonance. Let us arbitrarily refer to a “high-                                                             

The fraction (ω − ω0 )/( 12 B) may be interpreted as the “number of half-
bandwidths off resonance” and abbreviated by N . Thus,
                                     1
                            Y(s) ≈     (1 + jN )                            [19]
                                     R
where
                                       ω − ω0
                                N=       1
                                                                            [20]

                                           B
At the upper half-power frequency, ω2 ≈ ω0 + 12 B, N = +1, and we are
one half-bandwidth above resonance. For the lower half-power frequency,
ω1 ≈ ω0 − 12 B, so that N = −1, locating us one half-bandwidth below
resonance.
   Equation [19] is much easier to use than the exact relationships we have
had up to now. It shows that the magnitude of the admittance is
                                       1
                          |Y( jω)| ≈     1 + N2
                                       R
while the angle of Y( jω) is given by the inverse tangent of N :
                           ang Y( jω) ≈ tan−1 N



                                                                                    EXAMPLE 16.2
 Estimate the location of the two half-power frequencies of the
 voltage response of a parallel RLC network for which R  40 k,
                    1
 L  1 H, and C  64  μF, and determine the approximate value of
 the admittance for an operating frequency of 8200 rad/s.

 Identify the goal of the problem.
   We seek the lower and upper half-power frequencies of the voltage
   response as well as Y(ω0 ). Since we are asked to “estimate” and
   “approximate,” the implication is that this is a high-Q circuit, an
   assumption we should verify.
 Collect the known information.
   Given R, L, and C, we are able to compute ω0 and Q 0 . If Q 0 ≥ 5, we
   may invoke approximate expressions for half-power frequencies and
   admittance near resonance, but regardless could compute these quan-
   tities exactly if required.
 Devise a plan.
   To use approximate expressions, we must first determine Q 0 , the
   quality factor at resonance, as well as the bandwidth. √
      The resonant frequency ω0 is given by Eq. [2] as 1/ LC =
   8 krad/s. Thus, Q 0 = ω0 RC = 5, and the bandwidth is ω0 /Q 0 =
   1.6 krad/s. The value of Q 0 for this circuit is sufficient to employ
   “high-Q” approximations.

632   CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE



       Construct an appropriate set of equations.
         The bandwidth is simply
                                         ω0
                                  B=        = 1600 rad/s
                                         Q0
         and so

         Equation [19] states that
                                               1
                                      Y(s) ≈     (1 + jN )
                                               R
         so
                            1
               |Y( jω)| ≈     1 + N2           and      ang Y( jω) ≈ tan−1 N
                            R
       Determine if additional information is required.
         We still require N , which tells us how many half-bandwidths ω is
         from the resonant frequency ω0 :
                                N = (8.2 − 8)/0.8 = 0.25

       Attempt a solution.
         Now we are ready to employ our approximate relationships for the
         magnitude and angle of the network admittance,

                               ang Y ≈ tan−1 0.25 = 14.04◦
         and
                            |Y| ≈ 25 1 + (0.25)2 = 25.77 μS

       Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
         An exact calculation of the admittance using Eq. [1] shows that

                              Y( j8200) = 25.75/13.87◦ μS

         The approximate method therefore leads to values of admittance mag-
         nitude and angle that are reasonably accurate (better than 2 percent)
         for this frequency. We leave it to the reader to judge the accuracy of
         our prediction for ω1 and ω2 .

   We conclude our coverage of the parallel resonant circuit by reviewing
some key conclusions we have reached:
•    The resonant frequency ω0 is the frequency at which the imaginary
     part of the input admittance becomes zero, or the angle
                                                           √ of the
     admittance becomes zero. For this circuit, ω0 = 1/ LC.
•    The circuit’s figure of merit Q 0 is defined as 2π times the ratio of the
     maximum energy stored in the circuit to the energy lost each period in
     the circuit. For this circuit, Q 0 = ω0 RC.
•    We defined two half-power frequencies,   √ ω1 and ω2 , as the frequencies
     at which the admittance magnitude is 2 times the minimum
     admittance magnitude. (These are also the frequencies at which the
     voltage response is 70.7 percent of the maximum response.)
•    The exact expressions for ω1 and ω2 are
                                 ⎡                         ⎤

•    The approximate (high-Q 0 ) expressions for ω1 and ω2 are
                                    ω1,2 ≈ ω0 ∓ 12 B

•    The half-power bandwidth B is given by
                                                         ω0
                                  B = ω2 − ω1 =
                                                         Q0
•    The input admittance may also be expressed in approximate form for
     high-Q circuits:
                            1             1
                     Y≈       (1 + jN ) =   1 + N 2 /tan−1 N
                            R             R
     where N is defined as the number of half-bandwidths off resonance, or
                                                ω − ω0
                                      N=          1
                                                  2
                                                    B
     This approximation is valid for 0.9ω0 ≤ ω ≤ 1.1ω0 .

                                                                                     EXAMPLE 16.3
The voltage v s  100 cos ωt mV is applied to a series resonant
circuit composed of a 10  resistance, a 200 nF capacitance, and
a 2 mH inductance. Use both exact and approximate methods to
calculate the current amplitude if ω  48 krad/s.
The resonant frequency of the circuit is given by
                   1                    1
         ω0 = √         =                                = 50 krad/s
                   LC        (2 × 10−3 )(200 × 10−9 )
Since we are operating at ω = 48 krad/s, which is within 10 percent
of the resonant frequency, it is reasonable to apply our approximate
relationships to estimate the equivalent impedance of the network
provided that we find that we are working with a high-Q circuit:

                         Zeq ≈ R 1 + N 2 /tan−1 N

where N is computed once we determine Q 0 . This is a series circuit, so
                        ω0 L   (50 × 103 )(2 × 10−3 )
                Q0 =         =                        = 10
                         R              10
which qualifies as a high-Q circuit. Thus,
                            ω0   50 × 103
                       B=      =          = 5 krad/s
                            Q0      10
The number of half-bandwidths off resonance (N ) is therefore
                            ω − ω0   48 − 50
                       N=          =         = −0.8
                             B/2       2.5
Thus,
        Zeq ≈ R 1 + N 2 /tan−1 N = 12.81/−38.66◦ 

The approximate current magnitude is then
                         |Vs |    100
                               =       = 7.806 mA
                        |Zeq |   12.81
Using the exact expressions, we find that I = 7.746/39.24◦ mA and thus
                               |I| = 7.746 mA

          The series resonant circuit is characterized by a minimum impedance at
      resonance, whereas the parallel resonant circuit produces a maximum reso-
      nant impedance. The latter circuit provides inductor currents and capacitor
      currents at resonance which have amplitudes Q 0 times as great as the source
      current; the series resonant circuit provides inductor voltages and capacitor
      voltages which are greater than the source voltage by the factor Q 0s . The
      series circuit thus provides voltage amplification at resonance.
          A comparison of our results for series and parallel resonance, as well
      as the exact and approximate expressions we have developed, appears in
      Table 16.1.

    Before we learn how to develop such an equivalent circuit, let us first
consider the given√circuit, Fig. 16.9a. The resonant radian frequency for this
network is not 1/ LC , although if R1 is sufficiently small it may be very
close to this value. The definition of resonance is unchanged, and we may
determine the resonant frequency by setting the imaginary part of the input
admittance equal to zero:

It follows that the Q’s of the series and parallel networks must be equal:
                               Q p = Qs = Q

The transformation equations may therefore be simplified:
                              R p = Rs (1 + Q 2 )                            [22]

■ FIGURE 16.13 (a) A given series resonant circuit in which the capacitor voltage is to be measured by a nonideal electronic voltmeter.
  (b) The effect of the voltmeter is included in the circuit; it reads V c . (c) A series resonant circuit is obtained when the parallel RC network
  in part (b) is replaced by the series RC network which is equivalent at 105 rad/s.




    Before the voltmeter is connected, we compute that the resonant fre-
quency is 105 rad/s, Q 0 = 50, the current is 25 mA, and the rms capacitor
voltage is 25 V. (As indicated at the end of Sec. 16.3, this voltage is Q 0
times the applied voltage.) Thus, if the voltmeter were ideal, it would read
25 V when connected across the capacitor.
    However, when the actual voltmeter is connected, the circuit shown in
Fig. 16.13b results. In order to obtain a series RLC circuit, it is now neces-
sary to replace the parallel RC network with a series RC network. Let us
assume that the Q of this RC network is sufficiently high that the equivalent
series capacitor will be the same as the given parallel capacitor. We do this
in order to approximate the resonant frequency of the final series RLC
circuit. Thus, if the series RLC circuit also contains a 0.01 μF capacitor, the
resonant frequency remains 105 rad/s. We need to know this estimated res-
onant frequency in order to calculate the Q of the parallel RC network; it is
                              Rp
                    Q=              = ωR p C p = 105 (105 )(10−8 ) = 100
                             |X p |

Since this value is greater than 5, our vicious circle of assumptions is justi-
fied, and the equivalent series RC network consists of the capacitor Cs =
0.01 μF and the resistor
                                                    Rp

                                                    Q2

Hence, the equivalent circuit of Fig. 16.13c is obtained. The resonant Q of
this circuit is now only 33.3, and thus the voltage across the capacitor in the
circuit of Fig. 16.13c is 16 23 V. But we need to find |VC |, the voltage across
the series RC combination; we obtain
                                         0.5

                                                            O     nce upon a time there was a student named Sean, who had a professor
                                                                  identified simply as Dr. Abel.
                                                                In the laboratory one afternoon, Dr. Abel gave Sean three practical cir-

                                                            elements, to measure the resultant voltage across the resistor as a function
                                             +              of frequency, and then to calculate numerical values for the resonant fre-

                                                            Next, Sean made the measurements that Dr. Abel requested, compared them
                                                            with the predicted values, and then felt a strong urge to transfer to the busi-

                                                            Sean knew that discrepancies of this magnitude could not be characterized
                                                            as being “within engineering accuracy” or “due to meter errors.” Sadly, the
                                                            results were handed to the professor.
                                                                Remembering many past errors in judgment, some of which were even
                                                            (possibly) self-made, Dr. Abel smiled kindly and called Sean’s attention to
                                                            the Q-meter (or impedance bridge) which is present in most well-equipped
                                                            laboratories, and suggested that it might be used to find out what these prac-

                                                            resonance, 1000 Hz, for example.
                                                                Upon doing so, Sean discovered that the resistor had a measured value
                                                            of 18  and the inductor was 21.4 mH with a Q of 1.2, while the capacitor
                                                            had a capacitance of 1.41 μF and a dissipation factor (the reciprocal of Q)
                                                            equal to 0.123.
                                                                So, with the hope that springs eternal within the heart of every engi-

                                                            inductor would be 21.4 mH in series with ωL/Q = 112 , while a more

appropriate model for the capacitor would be 1.41 μF in series with
1/ωC Q = 13.9 . Using these data, Sean prepared the modified circuit
model shown as Fig. 16.15 and calculated a new set of predicted values:
                                             1
                         f0 =     √                          = 916 Hz
                                2π 21.4 × 10−3 × 1.41 × 10−6
                                     2π × 916 × 21.4 × 10−3
                             Q0 =                           = 0.856
                                             143.9
                                     B = 916/0.856 = 1070 Hz
Since these results were much closer to the measured values, Sean was
much happier. Dr. Abel, however, being a stickler for detail, pondered the
differences in the predicted and measured values for both Q 0 and the band-
width. “Have you,” Dr. Abel asked, “given any consideration to the output
impedance of the voltage source?” “Not yet,” said Sean, trotting back to the
laboratory bench.
    It turned out that the output impedance in question was 50  and so
Sean added this value to the circuit diagram, as shown in Fig. 16.16. Using
the new equivalent resistance value of 193.9 , improved values for Q 0 and
B were then obtained:
                                    Q 0 = 0.635              B = 1442 Hz

■ FIGURE 16.16 The final model also contains the output
  resistance of the voltage source.

Since all the theoretical and experimental values now agreed within 10 per-
cent, Sean was once again an enthusiastic, confident engineering student,
motivated to start homework early and read the textbook prior to class.1
Dr. Abel simply nodded her head agreeably as she moralized:
         When using real devices,
         Watch the models that you choose;
         Think well before you calculate,
         And mind your Z’s and Q’s!

every number on the ordinate scale is increased by a factor of 2000 and every
number on the abscissa scale is increased by a factor of 5 × 106. We will treat
this as two problems: (1) scaling in magnitude by a factor of 2000 and             Z'                 5 k⍀          1000 H       10 –3 F

    Magnitude scaling is defined as the process by which the impedance of
a two-terminal network is increased by a factor of K m , the frequency re-                                   (a)

smaller than unity. We will understand that the shorter statement ‘‘the net-       ⏐Z'⏐ (k⍀)
work is scaled in magnitude by a factor of 2” indicates that the impedance
                                                                                        5

Let us now determine how we must scale each type of passive element. To
increase the input impedance of a network by a factor of K m , it is sufficient         3
to increase the impedance of each element in the network by this same                   2
factor. Thus, a resistance R must be replaced by a resistance K m R. Each               1
inductance must also exhibit an impedance which is K m times as great at                                                       (rad/s)

When each element in the network of Fig. 16.17a is scaled in magnitude by
a factor of 2000, the network shown in Fig. 16.18a results. The response
curve shown in Fig. 16.18b indicates that no change in the previously
drawn response curve need be made other than a change in the scale of the
ordinate.
    Let us now take this new network and scale it in frequency. We define
frequency scaling as the process by which the frequency at which any im-
pedance occurs is increased by a factor of K f . Again, we will make use of
the shorter expression “the network is scaled in frequency by a factor of 2”
to indicate that the same impedance is now obtained at a frequency twice as
great. Frequency scaling is accomplished by scaling each passive element
in frequency. It is apparent that no resistor is affected. The impedance of any
inductor is sL, and if this same impedance is to be obtained at a frequency K f
times as great, then the inductance L must be replaced by an inductance of
L/K f . Similarly, a capacitance C is to be replaced by a capacitance C/K f .
Thus, if a network is to be scaled in frequency by a factor of K f , then the
changes necessary in each passive element are

                            When each element of the magnitude-scaled network of Fig. 16.18a is
                            scaled in frequency by a factor of 5 × 106 , the network of Fig. 16.19a
                            is obtained. The corresponding response curve is shown in Fig. 16.19b.
                                The circuit elements in this last network have values which are easily
                            achieved in physical circuits; the network can actually be built and tested. It
                            follows that, if the original network of Fig. 16.17a were actually an analog
                            of some mechanical resonant system, we could have scaled this analog in
                            both magnitude and frequency in order to achieve a network which we
                            might construct in the laboratory; tests that are expensive or inconvenient to
                            run on the mechanical system could then be made on the scaled electrical
                            system, and the results should then be “unscaled” and converted into me-
                            chanical units to complete the analysis.
                                An impedance that is given as a function of s may also be scaled in mag-
                            nitude or frequency, and this may be done without any knowledge of the
                            specific elements of which the two-terminal network is composed. In order
                            to scale Z(s) in magnitude, the definition of magnitude scaling shows that it
                            is necessary only to multiply Z(s) by K m in order to obtain the magnitude-
                            scaled impedance. Hence, the impedance Z (s) of the magnitude-scaled
                            network is

                                                                    Z (s) = K m Z(s)

                            If Z (s) is now to be scaled in frequency by a factor of 5 × 106 , then Z (s)
                            and Z (s) are to provide identical values of impedance if Z (s) is evaluated
                            at a frequency K f times that at which Z (s) is evaluated, or
                                                                                          

                                Although scaling is a process normally applied to passive elements, de-
                            pendent sources may also be scaled in magnitude and frequency. We assume
                            that the output of any source is given as k x vx or k y i y , where k x has the
                            dimensions of an admittance for a dependent current source and is dimen-
                            sionless for a dependent voltage source, while k y has the dimensions of
                            ohms for a dependent voltage source and is dimensionless for a dependent
                                                                             SECTION 16.5 SCALING                                                 647

current source. If the network containing the dependent source is scaled in
magnitude by K m , then it is necessary only to treat k x or k y as if it were the
type of element consistent with its dimensions. That is, if k x (or k y ) is di-
mensionless, it is left unchanged; if it is an admittance, it is divided by K m ;
and if it is an impedance, it is multiplied by K m . Frequency scaling does not
affect the dependent sources.

 Magnitude scaling of the capacitor is accomplished by dividing 0.05 F

 by dividing by K f = 50. Carrying out both operations simultaneously,

       this is a voltage-controlled current source, the multiplying constant 0.2
       has units of A/V, or S. Since the factor has units of admittance, we
       divide by K m , so that the new term is 0.01V1 . The resulting (scaled)
       network is shown in Fig. 16.20b.
          To find the impedance of the new network, we need to apply a 1 A

      16.6 BODE DIAGRAMS
             •
      In this section we will discover a quick method of obtaining an approximate
      picture of the amplitude and phase variation of a given transfer function as
      functions of ω. Accurate curves may, of course, be plotted after calculating
      values with a programmable calculator or a computer; curves may also be
      produced directly on the computer. Our object here, however, is to obtain a
      better picture of the response than we could visualize from a pole-zero plot,
      but yet not mount an all-out computational offensive.

The Decibel (dB) Scale
The approximate response curve we construct is called an asymptotic plot,
or a Bode plot, or a Bode diagram, after its developer, Hendrik W. Bode,
who was an electrical engineer and mathematician with the Bell Telephone
Laboratories. Both the magnitude and phase curves are shown using a
logarithmic frequency scale for the abscissa, and the magnitude itself is also
shown in logarithmic units called decibels (dB). We define the value of
|H( jω)| in dB as follows:                                                                              The decibel is named in honor of Alexander
                                                                                                        Graham Bell.
                                     HdB = 20 log |H( jω)|

where the common logarithm (base 10) is used. (A multiplier of 10 instead
of 20 is used for power transfer functions, but we will not need it here.) The
inverse operation is

                                       |H( jω)| = 10 HdB /20

    Before we actually begin a detailed discussion of the technique for
drawing Bode diagrams, it will help to gain some feeling for the size of the
decibel unit, to learn a few of its important values, and to recall some of
the properties of the logarithm. Since log 1 = 0, log 2 = 0.30103, and
log 10 = 1, we note the correspondences:

                               |H( jω)| = 1 ⇔ HdB = 0
                               |H( jω)| = 2 ⇔ HdB ≈ 6 dB
                               |H( jω)| = 10 ⇔ HdB = 20 dB

An increase of |H( jω)| by a factor of 10 corresponds to an increase in HdB
by 20 dB. Moreover, log 10n = n, and thus 10n ⇔ 20n dB, so that 1000
corresponds to 60 dB, while 0.01 is represented as −40 dB. Using only the
values already given, we may also note that 20 log 5 = 20 log 10        2
                                                                          =
20 log
    √  10 − 20 log 2 = 20 −  6 = 14
                                 √    dB,   and  thus
                                                    √  5 ⇔   14   dB.  Also,
log x = 12 log x , and therefore 2 ⇔ 3 dB and 1/ 2 ⇔ −3 dB.2
    We will write our transfer functions in terms of s, substituting s = jω
when we are ready to find the magnitude or phase angle. If desired, the mag-
nitude may be written in terms of dB at that point.

(2) Note that we are being slightly
customary, however, to represent 2 as 3 dB; since the dB scale is inherently logarithmic, the small
inaccuracy is seldom significant.

intersect at ω = a, the frequency of the zero. This frequency is also desc-
ribed as the corner, break, 3 dB, or half-power frequency.


Smoothing Bode Plots
Let us see how much error is embodied in our asymptotic response curve.
At the corner frequency (ω = a),
                                                                                     Note that we continue to abide by the convention

                      HdB = 20 log 1 +         = 3 dB                                 of taking 2 as corresponding to 3 dB.
                                            a2

as compared with an asymptotic value of 0 dB. At ω = 0.5a, we have
                                   √
                      HdB = 20 log 1.25 ≈ 1 dB

Thus, the exact response is represented by a smooth curve that lies 3 dB
above the asymptotic response at ω = a, and 1 dB above it at ω = 0.5a
(and also at ω = 2a). This information can always be used to smooth out the
corner if a more exact result is desired.


Multiple Terms
Most transfer functions will consist of more than a simple zero (or simple
pole). This, however, is easily handled by the Bode method, since we are in
fact working with logarithms. For example, consider a function
                                          

which is simply the sum of a constant (frequency-independent) term 20 log K

we may construct a sketch of HdB by simply graphically adding the plots of
the separate terms. We explore this in the following example.

                                                              Since the angle is 45◦ at ω = a, we now construct the straight-line asymp-

also be drawn in a manner similar to that depicted in Fig. 16.24 by the

  (smoothed) response.


    It is worth pausing briefly here to consider what the phase plot is telling
us. In the case of a simple zero at s = a, we see that for frequencies much
less than the corner frequency, the phase of the response function is 0◦ . For
high frequencies, however (ω  a), the phase is 90◦ . In the vicinity of the
corner frequency, the phase of the transfer function varies somewhat
rapidly. The actual phase angle imparted to the response can therefore be
selected through the design of the circuit (which determines a).

Additional Considerations in Creating Bode Plots
We next consider a simple pole,

                                        H(s) =                                              [27]
                                                   1 + s/a
Since this is the reciprocal of a zero, the logarithmic operation leads to a Bode
plot which is the negative of that obtained previously. The amplitude is 0 dB
up to ω = a, and then the slope is −20 dB/decade for ω > a. The angle plot
is 0◦ for ω < 0.1a, −90◦ for ω > 10a, and −45◦ at ω = a, and it has a slope
of −45◦/decade when 0.1a < ω < 10a. The reader is encouraged to generate
the Bode plot for this function by working directly with Eq. [27].

                                     Another term that can appear in H(s) is a factor of s in the numerator or
                                  denominator. If H(s) = s, then
                                                                          HdB = 20 log |ω|
                                      Thus, we have an infinite straight line passing through 0 dB at ω = 1 and
                                  having a slope everywhere of 20 dB/decade. This is shown in Fig. 16.25a.
                                  If the s factor occurs in the denominator, a straight line is obtained having a
                                  slope of −20 dB/decade and passing through 0 dB at ω = 1, as shown in

                                      Another simple term found in H(s) is the multiplying constant K . This
                                  yields a Bode plot which is a horizontal straight line lying 20 log |K | dB

   Before we construct the phase plot for the amplifier of Fig. 16.26, let us
take a few moments to investigate several of the details of the magnitude
plot.
   First, it is wise not to rely too heavily on graphical addition of the indi-
vidual magnitude plots. Instead, the exact value of the combined magnitude
plot may be found easily at selected points by considering the asymptotic
656              CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE


                 value of each factor of H(s) at the point in question. For example, in the flat
                 region of Fig. 16.27a between ω = 10 and ω = 20,000, we are below the
                 corner at ω = 20,000, and so we represent (1 + s/20,000) by 1; but we are
                 above ω = 10, so (1 + s/10) is represented as ω/10. Hence,
                                                       
                                            −2ω 
                             HdB = 20 log             
                                             (ω/10)(1) 
                                  = 20 log 20 = 26 dB         (10 < ω < 20,000)

                 We might also wish to know the frequency at which the asymptotic re-
                 sponse crosses the abscissa at the high end. The two factors are expressed
                 here as ω/10 and ω/20,000; thus
                                                                               
                                                −2ω                            
                          HdB = 20 log                      = 20 log  400,000 
                                          (ω/10)(ω/20,000)                 ω 

                 Since HdB = 0 at the abscissa crossing, 400,000/ω = 1, and therefore
                 ω = 400,000 rad/s.
                     Many times we do not need an accurate Bode plot drawn on printed
                 semilog paper. Instead we construct a rough logarithmic frequency axis
                 on simple lined paper. After selecting the interval for a decade—say, a dis-
                 tance L extending from ω = ω1 to ω = 10ω1 (where ω1 is usually an
                 integral power of 10)—we let x locate the distance that ω lies to the right
                 of ω1 , so that x/L = log(ω/ω1 ). Of particular help is the knowledge that
                 x = 0.3L when ω = 2ω1 , x = 0.6L at ω = 4ω1 , and x = 0.7L at ω = 5ω1 .


  EXAMPLE 16.9
                  Draw the phase plot for the transfer function given by Eq. [28],
                  H(s)  −2s/[(1 + s/10)(1 + s/20,000)].
                  We begin by inspecting H( jω):
                                                       − j2ω
                                  H( jω) =                                                [29]
                                             (1 + jω/10)(1 + jω/20,000)
                  The angle of the numerator is a constant, −90◦ .
                      The remaining factors are represented as the sum of the angles con-
                  tributed by break points at ω = 10 and ω = 20,000. These three terms
                  appear as broken-line asymptotic curves in Fig. 16.28, and their sum is
                  shown as the solid curve. An equivalent representation is obtained if the
                  curve is shifted upward by 360◦ .
                      Exact values can also be obtained for the asymptotic phase response.
                  For example, at ω = 104 rad/s, the angle in Fig. 16.28 is obtained from
                  the numerator and denominator terms in Eq. [29]. The numerator angle
                  is −90◦. The angle for the pole at ω = 10 is −90◦, since ω is greater than
                  10 times the corner frequency. Between 0.1 and 10 times the corner fre-
                  quency, we recall that the slope is −45◦ per decade for a simple pole.
                  For the break point at 20,000 rad/s, we therefore calculate the angle,
                  −45◦ log(ω/0.1a) = −45◦ log[10,000/(0.1 × 20,000)] = −31.5◦.

Higher-Order Terms
The zeros and poles that we have been considering are all first-order terms,
such as s±1 , (1 + 0.2s)±1 , and so forth. We may extend our analysis
to higher-order poles and zeros very easily, however. A term s±n yields
a magnitude response that passes through ω = 1 with a slope of
±20n dB/decade; the phase response is a constant angle of ±90n ◦ . Also, a
multiple zero, (1 + s/a)n , must represent the sum of n of the magnitude-
response curves, or n of the phase-response curves of the simple zero. We
therefore obtain an asymptotic magnitude plot that is 0 dB for ω < a and
has a slope of 20n dB/decade when ω > a; the error is −3n dB at ω = a,
and −n dB at ω = 0.5a and 2a. The phase plot is 0◦ for ω < 0.1a, 90n ◦ for
ω > 10a , 45n ◦ at ω = a , and a straight line with a slope of 45n ◦ /
decade for 0.1a < ω < 10a, and it has errors as large as ±5.71n ◦ at two
frequencies.
    The asymptotic magnitude and phase curves associated with a factor
such as (1 + s/20)−3 may be drawn quickly, but the relatively large errors
associated with the higher powers should be kept in mind.
658   CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE


      Complex Conjugate Pairs
      The last type of factor we should consider represents a conjugate complex
      pair of poles or zeros. We adopt the following as the standard form for a pair
      of zeros:
                                               2
                                               s         s
                            H(s) = 1 + 2ζ          +
                                              ω0        ω0
      The quantity ζ is the damping factor introduced in Sec. 16.1, and we will
      see shortly that ω0 is the corner frequency of the asymptotic response.
          If ζ = 1, we see that H(s) = 1 + 2(s/ω0 ) + (s/ω0 )2 = (1 + s/ω0 )2 , a
      second-order zero such as we have just considered. If ζ > 1, then H(s) may
      be factored to show two simple zeros. Thus, if ζ = 1.25, then H(s) =
      1 + 2.5(s/ω0 ) + (s/ω0 )2 = (1 + s/2ω0 )(1 + s/0.5ω0 ), and we again have
      a familiar situation.
          A new case arises when 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1. There is no need to find values for
      the conjugate complex pair of roots. Instead, we determine the low- and
      high-frequency asymptotic values for both the magnitude and phase re-
      sponse, and then apply a correction that depends on the value of ζ .
          For the magnitude response, we have
                                                         2 

      When ω  ω0 , HdB = 20 log |1| = 0 dB. This is the low-frequency asymp-
      tote. Next, if ω  ω0 , only the squared term is important, and HdB =
      20 log |−(ω/ω0 )2 | = 40 log(ω/ω0 ). We have a slope of +40 dB/decade.
      This is the high-frequency asymptote, and the two asymptotes intersect at
      0 dB, ω = ω0 . The solid curve in Fig. 16.29 shows this asymptotic repre-
      sentation of the magnitude response. However, a correction must be applied

in the neighborhood of the corner frequency. We let ω = ω0 in Eq. [30] and

If ζ = 1, a limiting case, the correction is +6 dB; for ζ = 0.5, no correction
is required; and if ζ = 0.1, the correction is −14 dB. Knowing this one cor-
rection value is often sufficient to draw a satisfactory asymptotic magnitude
response. Figure 16.29 shows more accurate curves for ζ = 1, 0.5, 0.25,
and 0.1, as calculated from Eq. [30]. For example, if ζ = 0.25, then the
exact value of HdB at ω = 0.5ω0 is
  HdB = 20 log |1 + j0.25 − 0.25| = 20 log 0.752 + 0.252 = −2.0 dB
The negative peaks do not show a minimum value exactly at ω = ω0 , as we
can see by the curve for ζ = 0.5. The valley is always found at a slightly
lower frequency.
    If ζ = 0, then H( jω0 ) = 0 and HdB = −∞. Bode plots are not usually
drawn for this situation.
    Our last task is to draw the asymptotic phase response for H( jω) = 1 +
 j2ζ(ω/ω0 ) − (ω/ω0 )2 . Below ω = 0.1ω0 , we let ang H( jω) = 0◦ ; above
ω = 10ω0 , we have ang H( jω) = ang [−(ω/ω0 )2 ] = 180◦ . At the corner
frequency, ang H( jω0 ) = ang ( j2ζ ) = 90◦ . In the interval 0.1ω0 <
ω < 10ω0 , we begin with the straight line shown as a solid curve in
Fig. 16.30. It extends from (0.1ω0 , 0◦ ), through (ω0 , 90◦ ), and terminates at
(10ω0 , 180◦ ); it has a slope of 90◦ /decade.

                                                        2ζ(ω/ω0 )

One accurate value above and one below ω = ω0 may be sufficient to give
an approximate shape to the curve. If we take ω = 0.5ω0 , we find
ang H( j0.5ω0 ) = tan−1 (4ζ /3), while the angle is 180◦ − tan−1 (4ζ /3) at

                  ω = 2ω0. Phase curves are shown as broken lines in Fig. 16.30 for ζ = 1, 0.5,
                  0.25, and 0.1; heavy dots identify accurate values at ω = 0.5ω0 and ω = 2ω0.
                     If the quadratic factor appears in the denominator, both the magnitude
                  and phase curves are the negatives of those just discussed. We conclude
                  with an example that contains both linear and quadratic factors.


  EXAMPLE 16.10
                   Construct the Bode plot for the transfer function H(s) 
                   100,000s/[(s + 1)(10,000 + 20s + s2)].
                   Let’s consider the quadratic factor first and arrange it in a form such
                   that we can see the value of ζ . We begin by dividing the second-order
                   factor by its constant term, 10,000:
                                                            10s
                                   H(s) =
                                             (1 + s)(1 + 0.002s + 0.0001s2 )
                                                                        √
                   An inspection of the s2 term next shows that ω0 = 1/0.0001 = 100.
                   Then the linear term of the quadratic is written to display the factor 2,
                   the factor (s/ω0 ), and finally the factor ζ :
                                                            10s
                               H(s) =
                                        (1 + s)[1 + (2)(0.1)(s/100) + (s/100)2 ]
                   We see that ζ = 0.1.
                      The asymptotes of the magnitude-response curve are sketched in
                   lightly in Fig. 16.31: 20 dB for the factor of 10, an infinite straight line
                   through ω = 1 with a +20 dB/decade slope for the s factor, a corner
                   at ω = 1 for the simple pole, and a corner at ω = 100 with a slope of
                   −40 dB/decade for the second-order term in the denominator. Adding
                   these four curves and supplying a correction of +14 dB for the qua-
                   dratic factor lead to the heavy curve of Fig. 16.31.

The technique of generating Bode plots is a valuable one. There are
many situations in which an approximate diagram is needed quickly
(such as on exams, or when evaluating a particular circuit topology for a
specific application), and simply knowing the general shape of the re-
sponse is adequate. Further, Bode plots can be invaluable when design-
ing filters in terms of enabling us to select factors and coefficient values.
    In situations where exact response curves are required (such as when
verifying a final circuit design), there are several computer-assisted op-
tions available to the engineer. The first technique we will consider here
is the use of MATLAB to generate a frequency response curve. In order
to accomplish this, the circuit must first be analyzed to obtain the cor-
rect transfer function. However, it is not necessary to factor or simplify
the expression.
    Consider the circuit in Fig. 16.26. We previously determined that the
transfer function for this circuit can be expressed as
                                           −2s
                       H(s) =
                                 (1 + s/10)(1 + s/20,000)

                                                                  (Continued on next page)
662   CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE



       We seek a detailed graph of this function over the frequency range of
       100 mrad/s to 1 Mrad/s. Since the final graph will be plotted on a
       logarithmic scale, there is no need to uniformly space our discrete
       frequencies. Instead, we use the MATLAB function logspace() to gen-
       erate a frequency vector, where the first two arguments represent the
       power of 10 for starting and ending frequencies, respectively (−1 and
       6 in the present example), and the third argument is the total number of
       points desired. Thus, our MATLAB script is
                  EDU» w = logspace(−1,6,100);
                  EDU» denom = (1+j*w/10) .* (1+j*w/20000);
                  EDU» H = −2*j*w ./ denom;
                  EDU» Hdb = 20*log10(abs(H));
                  EDU» semilogx(w,Hdb)
                  EDU» xlabel(’frequency (rad/s)’)
                  EDU» ylabel (’|H(jw)| (dB)’)
       which yields the graph depicted in Fig. 16.33.




       ■ FIGURE 16.33 Plot of H dB generated using MATLAB.


          A few comments about the MATLAB code are warranted. First, note
       that we have substituted s = jω in our expression for H(s). Also,
       MATLAB treats the variable w as a vector, or one-dimensional matrix.
       As such, this variable can cause difficulties in the denominator of an
       expression as MATLAB will attempt to apply matrix algebra rules to any
       expression. Thus, the denominator of H( jω) is computed in a separate
       line, and the operator “.*” is required instead of “*” to multiply the two
       terms. This new operator is equivalent to the following MATLAB code:
                    EDU» for k = 1:100
                    denom = (1 + j*w(k)/10) * (1 + j*w(k)/20000);
                    end
          In a similar fashion, the new operator “./” is used in the subsequent
       line of code. The results are desired in dB, so the function log10() is
                                                                    SECTION 16.6 BODE DIAGRAMS   663


invoked; log() represents the natural logarithm in MATLAB. Finally,
the new plot command semilogx() is used to generate a graph with the
x axis having a logarithmic scale. The reader is encouraged at this point
to return to previous examples, and use these techniques to generate
exact curves for comparison to the corresponding Bode plots.
    PSpice is also commonly used to generate frequency response
curves, especially to evaluate a final design. Figure 16.34a depicts the
circuit of Fig. 16.26, where the voltage across the resistor R3 represents
the desired output voltage. The source component VAC has been

                                  simulation is required to determine the frequency response of our
                                  circuit; Fig. 16.34b was generated using 10 points per decade (with
                                  Decade selected under Logarithmic AC Sweep Type) from 10 mHz to
                                  1 MHz. Note the simulation has been performed in Hz, not rad/s, so the
                                  cursor tool is indicating a bandwidth of 3.137 kHz.
                                     Again, the reader is encouraged to simulate example circuits and
                                  compare the results to the Bode plots generated previously.

                                 The design of filters is a very practical (and interesting) subject, worthy of a
                                 separate textbook in its own right. In this section, we introduce some of the
                                 basic concepts of filtering, and explore both passive and active filter circuits.
                                 These circuits may be very simple, consisting of a single capacitor or induc-
                                 tor whose addition to a given network leads to improved performance. They
                                 may also be fairly sophisticated, consisting of many resistors, capacitors, in-
                                 ductors, and op amps in order to obtain the precise response curve required

for a given application. Filters are used in modern electronics to obtain dc
voltages in power supplies, eliminate noise in communication channels,
separate radio and television channels from the multiplexed signal provided
by antennas, and boost the bass signal in a car stereo, to name just a few
applications.
     The underlying concept of a filter is that it selects the frequencies that
may pass through a network. There are several varieties, depending on the
needs of a particular application. A low-pass filter, the response of which is
illustrated in Fig. 16.35a, passes frequencies below a cutoff frequency,
while significantly damping frequencies above that cutoff. A high-pass
filter, on the other hand, does just the opposite, as shown in Fig. 16.35b. The
chief figure of merit of a filter is the sharpness of the cutoff, or the steepness
of the curve in the vicinity of the corner frequency. In general, steeper
response curves require more complex circuits.
     Combining a low-pass and a high-pass filter can lead to what is known as
a bandpass filter, as illustrated by the response curve shown in Fig. 16.35c.
In this type of filter, the region between the two corner frequencies is referred
to as the passband; the region outside the passband is referred to as the stop-
band. These terms may also be applied to the low- and high-pass filters, as
indicated in Fig. 16.35a and b. We can also create a bandstop filter, which
allows both high and low frequencies to pass but attenuates any signal with
a frequency between the two corner frequencies (Fig. 16.35d).
     The notch filter is a specialized bandstop filter, designed with a narrow
response characteristic that blocks a single frequency component of a
signal. Multiband filters are also possible; these are filter circuits which
have multiple passbands and stopbands. The design of such filters is                                     R
straightforward, but beyond the range of this book.                                            +                                +

A filter can be constructed by simply using a single capacitor and a single
resistor, as shown in Fig. 16.36a. The transfer function for this low-pass fil-
ter circuit is                                                                                                 (a)

H(s) has a single corner frequency, which occurs at ω = 1/RC, and a zero
at s = ∞, leading to its “low-pass” filtering behavior. Low frequencies
(s → 0) result in |H(s)| near its maximum value (unity, or 0 dB), and high
frequencies (s → ∞) result in |H(s)| → 0. This behavior can be understood
qualitatively by considering the impedance of the capacitor: as the fre-
quency increases, the capacitor begins to act like a short-circuit to ac signals,
leading to a reduction in the output voltage. An example response curve for
such a filter with R = 500  and C = 2 nF is shown in Fig. 16.36b; the cor-
ner frequency of 159 kHz (1 Mrad/s) can be found by moving the cursor
to −3 dB. The sharpness of the response curve in the vicinity of the cutoff
frequency can be improved by moving to a circuit containing additional re-                                     (b)
active (i.e., capacitive and/or inductive) elements.                                    ■ FIGURE 16.36 (a) A simple low-pass RC filter.

Bandpass Filters
We have already seen several circuits earlier in this chapter which could
be classified as “bandpass” filters (e.g., Figs. 16.1 and 16.8). Consider the                            L          C
simple circuit of Fig. 16.39, in which the output is taken across the resistor.

    We know from our experience with Bode plots that Eq. [33] represents
three critical frequencies: one zero and two poles. In order to obtain a band-
pass filter response with a peak value of unity (0 dB), both pole frequencies
must be greater than 1 rad/s, the 0 dB crossover frequency of the zero term.
These two critical frequencies can be obtained by factoring
                                                          √ Eq. [33] or de-
termining the values of ω at which Eq. [34] is√equal to 1/ 2. The center fre-
quency of this filter then occurs at ω = 1/ LC . Thus, applying a√minor
amount of algebraic manipulation after setting Eq. [34] equal to 1/ 2, we
find that
                                     2
                            1 − LCωc2 = ωc2 R 2 C 2                       [35]
Taking the square root of both sides yields
                          LCωc2 + RCωc − 1 = 0
Applying the quadratic equation, we find that
                                   √
                              R       R 2 C 2 + 4LC

                             2L           2LC

Negative frequency is a nonphysical solution to our original equation, and
so only the positive radicand of Eq. [36] is applicable. However, we may
have been a little too hasty in taking the positive square root of both sides of
Eq. [35]. Considering the negative square root as well, which is equally
valid, we also obtain
                                      √
                                 R       R 2 C 2 + 4LC
                         ωc =       ±                                      [37]
                                2L           2LC
from which it can be shown that only the positive radicand is physical. Thus,
we obtain ω L from Eq. [36] and ω H from Eq. [37]; since ω H − ω L = B,
simple algebra shows that B = R/L .

                   and a high-frequency cutoff of 1.1 MHz.
                   We choose the circuit topology of Fig. 16.39, and begin by determining
                   the corner frequencies required. The bandwidth is given by f H − f L , so
                                         f L = 1.1 × 106 − 1 × 106 = 100 kHz

                   The high-frequency cutoff (ω H ) is simply 6.912 Mrad/s.
                      In order to proceed to design a circuit with these characteristics, it is
                   necessary to obtain an expression for each frequency in terms of the
                   variables R, L, and C.
                      Setting Eq. [37] equal to 2π(1.1 × 106 ) allows us to solve for 1/LC ,
                   as we already know that B = 2π( f H − f L ) = 6.283 × 106 .

                   Solving, we find that 1/LC = 4.343 × 1012 . Arbitrarily selecting
                   L = 50 mH, we obtain R = 314 k and C = 4.6 pF. It should be noted
                   that there is no unique solution for this “design” problem—R, L, or C

 16.17 Design a bandpass filter with a low-frequency cutoff of 100 rad/s
 and a high-frequency cutoff of 10 krad/s.
 Ans: One possible answer of many: R = 990 , L = 100 mH, and C = 10 μF.

     The type of circuit we have been considering is known as a passive
filter, as it is constructed of only passive components (i.e., no transistors, op
amps, or other “active” elements). Although passive filters are relatively
common, they are not well suited to all applications. The gain (defined as
the output voltage divided by the input voltage) of a passive filter can be dif-
ficult to set, and amplification is often desirable in filter circuits.

Active Filters
The use of an active element such as the op amp in filter design can overcome
many of the shortcomings of passive filters. As we saw in Chap. 6, op amp
circuits can easily be designed to provide gain. Op amp circuits can also
exhibit inductorlike behavior through the strategic location of capacitors.
    The internal circuitry of an op amp contains very small capacitances
(typically on the order of 100 pF), and these limit the maximum frequency
at which the op amp will function properly. Thus, any op amp circuit will
behave as a low-pass filter, with a cutoff frequency for modern devices of
perhaps 20 MHz or more (depending on the circuit gain).

                                                                                                EXAMPLE 16.13
 Design an active low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 kHz
 and a voltage gain of 40 dB.
 For frequencies much less than 10 kHz, we require an amplifier circuit
 capable of providing a gain of 40 dB, or 100 V/V. This can be accom-
 plished by simply using a noninverting amplifier (such as the one
 shown in Fig. 16.41a) with

                                                   function-like” magnitude response. Fortunately, we have alternatives—
                                                   known as higher-order filters—with improved behavior, at the cost of
                                                   increased complexity and more components. For example, the general low-
                                                   pass filter transfer function of order n may be written as
                                                                                                    K a0

To represent a bandpass filter, we need only alter the numerator to K sn/2 ,
and the band-reject filter (shown in Fig. 16.35d) has the transfer function
                                              n/2

Design of a specific filter, then, requires selecting the appropriate transfer
function, and choosing a class of polynomials which specify the coefficients
a1 , a2, etc. In this section, we introduce filters based on Butterworth and
Chebyshev polynomials, two of the most commonly employed in filter design.
     The low-pass Butterworth filter is one of the best-known filters. It is
characterized by an amplitude magnitude
                                    K

which is sketched in Fig. 16.47a for n = 1, 2, 3, and 5; K is a real constant,
and ωc represents the critical frequency. As can be seen, the magnitude
approaches a step-function-like shape as the order n increases. In contrast,
the low-pass Chebyshev filter is characterized by rather prominent ripples
in the passband, the number of which depends upon the order of the filter as
illustrated in Fig. 16.47b. Its magnitude response is described by
                                             K
                |H( jω)| =                                         n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
                                   1 + β 2 Cn2 (ω/ωc )
where β is a real constant known as the ripple factor and Cn (ω/ωc ) denotes
the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of degree n. For convenience,
selected coefficients of both polynomial types are listed in Table 16.2.

The Sallen-Key Amplifier
As seen in Sec. 15.8, we may create an op-amp-based filter circuit having a
double pole simply by cascading two circuits such as the one shown in
Fig. 15.49a, in which case we obtain a transfer function

Design a second-order low-pass Butterworth filter having a gain of
4 and a corner frequency at 1400 rad/s.
We begin by selecting the Sallen-Key prototype shown in Fig. 16.48,
and opt for the simplification which arises when we set R1 = R2 = R
and C1 = C2 = C. With a second-order Butterworth filter we expect
from Table 16.2 to have a denominator polynomial
                               s2 + 1.4142s + 1
and comparing to Eq. [42]
                                    RC = 1
and
                             2   1−G
                               +     = 1.414
                            RC    RC

hence
                                  RA + RB
                           G=             = 1.586
                                    RB

We first set values for the two resistors in our gain network (which do
not need to undergo scaling) by arbitrarily choosing R B = 1 k, so that
R A = 586 .
   Next, we note that if C = 1 F, then R = 1 , neither of which is a
particularly conventional value. Instead we select C = 1 μF; this
requires scaling the resistor by 106. We also need to frequency-scale
to 1400 rad/s. Thus,
                                      1F        1F
                         10−6 F =           =
                                     km k f   1400km

and km = 714 . Consequently, R = km R = 714 .
   Unfortunately, our design is not quite done. We were constrained to
an amplifier gain of 1.586, or 4 dB, but the specifications called for a
gain of 4, or 12 dB. The only option available to us is to feed the output
of our circuit into a noninverting amplifier such as the one in Fig. 6.6a.
Choosing 1 k and 1.52 k for R1 (output stage) and R f completes the
design.

                      Design of high-pass filters based on the Sallen-Key model is similarly
                  straightforward; the only modification required is to replace capacitors C1
                  and C2 with resistors, and resistors R1 and R2 with capacitors. The remain-
                  der of the circuit remains unchanged. Nodal analysis of the resulting circuit
                  with C1 = C2 = C and R1 = R2 = R yields
                                                           1

                  as we found for the low-pass filter.
                      Higher-order filters can be realized by cascading appropriate op amp
                  stages. For example, Butterworth filters of odd order (e.g., 3, 5, . . .) require
                  an additional pole at s = −1. Thus, a third-order Butterworth filter is
                  constructed using a Sallen-Key stage which provides a transfer function
                  denominator D(s) of
                                                        2

                  with an additional op amp stage such as the one in Fig. 15.49a to provide the
                  term (s + 1).

                   We begin by again selecting the Sallen-Key prototype shown in

                   R1 = R2 = R and C1 = C2 = C . We will also add an input stage of the
                   form shown in Fig. 15.49a to add the necessary pole. The basic design
                   is shown in Fig. 16.49.

 Comparing Eqs. [41], [42], and [43], we determine that our design must
 ensure that
                                         1
                                  1=
                                        R2C 2
 and
                                       3−G
                                  1=
                                        RC
 Consequently, RC = 1 and G = 4. If we choose R A = 3 k, it follows
 that R B = 1 k. We may scale these values later if we choose when
 adjusting for operation at 2000 rad/s, but this is unnecessary as the dc
 gain is set by the ratio of the two resistors.
    Initially we design for R = 1  and C = 1 F as this automatically
 satifies the RC = 1 requirement. Neither value being easy to locate,
 however, we select a more reasonable capacitor value of 0.1 μF, which
 combined with our frequency scaling factor k f = 2000, results in a
 resistor scaling factor km = 5000. Thus, R = 5 k in our final design.
    All that remains is to select values for R1 , R f , and C f in our front-
 end stage. Recall that the transfer function of this stage is
                                     1/R1 C f
                              −
                                  s + (1/R f C f )
 Setting R f = 1  and C f = 1 F initially allows the pole to be properly
 located prior to scaling operations, which dictate that we build the
 circuit with R f = 5 k and C f = 0.1 μF. Our only remaining choice,
 then, is to ensure that R1 allows us to meet our gain requirement of 4.
 Since we have already achieved this with our Sallen-Key stage, R1
 must be equal to R f , or 5 k.


    Design of Chebyshev filters proceeds along the same lines as that of
Butterworth filters, except we have more choices now with the ripple factor.
Also, for filters not having a 3 dB ripple factor, the critical frequency is
where the ripple channel in the passband terminates, which is slightly dif-
ferent than what we have specified previously. Filters with order n > 2 are
constructed by cascading stages, either multiple Sallen-Key stages for even
orders, or a simple stage such as Fig. 15.49a in conjunction with the appro-
priate number of Sallen-Key stages for odd orders. For filters with a specific
gain requirement, an op amp stage containing only resistors is typically
required at the output.


SUMMARY AND REVIEW
We began this chapter with a short discussion of resonance. Of course the
reader was likely to already have an intuitive understanding of the basic
concept—timing when to kick our legs on a swing as a child; watching
videos of crystal glasses shattering under the power of a trained soprano’s
voice; instinctively slowing down when driving over a corrugated surface. In
678   CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE


      the context of linear circuit analysis, we found (perhaps surprisingly) that a
      frequency can be chosen even for networks with capacitors and inductors
      such that the voltage and current are in phase (hence the network appears
      purely resistive at that particular frequency). How quickly our circuit
      response changes as we move “off resonance” was related to a new term—
      the quality factor (Q) of our circuit. After defining what is meant by critical
      frequencies for our circuit response, we introduced the concept of bandwidth,
      and discovered that our expressions may be simplified rather dramatically for
      high-Q (Q > 5) circuits. We briefly extended this discussion to consider the
      differences between series and parallel circuits near resonance, along with
      more practical networks which cannot be classed as either.
          The remainder of this chapter dealt with the analysis and design of filter
      circuits. Prior to launching into that discussion, the topic of “scaled” circuit
      components dealt with both frequency and magnitude scaling as a conve-
      nient design tool. We also introduced the handy method of Bode plots,
      which allows us to quickly sketch a reasonable approximation to the
      response of a filter circuit as a function of frequency. We next considered
      both passive and active filters, starting with simple designs using a single
      capacitor to achieve either low-pass or high-pass behavior. Shortly there-
      after, bandpass filter design was studied. Although they are straightforward
      to work with, the response of such simple circuits is not particularly abrupt.
      As an alternative, filter designs based on either Butterworth or Chebyshev
      polynomials were examined, with higher-order filters yielding sharper mag-
      nitude response at the expense of increased complexity.
      ❑   Resonance is the condition in which a fixed-amplitude sinusoidal
          forcing function produces a response of maximum amplitude.
          (Example 16.1)
      ❑   An electrical network is in resonance when the voltage and current at
          the network input terminals are in phase. (Example 16.1)
      ❑   The quality factor is proportional to the maximum energy stored in a
          network divided by the total energy lost per period.
      ❑   A half-power frequency is defined as the frequency at√which the mag-
          nitude of a circuit response function is reduced to 1/ 2 times its maxi-
          mum value.
      ❑   A high-Q circuit is a resonant circuit in which the quality factor
          is ≥ 5. (Example 16.2)
      ❑   The bandwidth of a resonant circuit is defined as the difference
          between the upper and lower half-power frequencies.
      ❑   In a high-Q circuit, each half-power frequency is located approximately
          one-half bandwidth from the resonant frequency. (Example 16.2)
      ❑   A series resonant circuit is characterized by a low impedance at
          resonance, whereas a parallel resonant circuit is characterized by a
          high impedance at resonance. (Examples 16.1 and 16.3)
      ❑   A series resonant circuit and a parallel resonant circuit are equivalent if
          R p = Rs (1 + Q 2 ) and X p = X s (1 + Q −2 ). (Examples 16.4, 16.5)
      ❑   Impractical values for components often make design easier. The trans-
          fer function of a network may be scaled in magnitude or frequency
          using appropriate replacement values for components. (Example 16.6)
                                                                               EXERCISES                                     679

❑   Bode diagrams allow the rough shape of a transfer function to be
    plotted quickly from the poles and zeros. (Examples 16.7, 16.8,
    16.9, 16.10)
❑   The four basic types of filters are low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and
    bandstop. (Examples 16.11, 16.12)
❑   Passive filters use only resistors, capacitors, and inductors; active
    filters are based on op amps or other active elements. (Example 16.13)
❑   Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can be designed based on the simple
    Sallen-Key amplifier. Filter gain typically must be adjusted by adding a
    purely resistor-based amplifier circuit at the output.

    mine (a) the magnitude of the impedance at 500 Mrad/s; (b) the current which
    flows in response to a voltage vs = 2.5 cos(425 × 106 t) V.

    tor value such that Q 0 is reduced to 5, and (a) estimate the angle of the imped-
    ance at 90 krad/s, 100 krad/s, and 110 krad/s. (b) Determine the percent error
    in the estimated values, compared to the exact expression.

    the circuit is (a) parallel-connected; (b) series-connected. (c) Verify your solu-
    tions using appropriate PSpice simulations. (Hint: a large resistor in parallel
    with the capacitor will avoid error messages associated with no dc path to
    ground, and a small resistance in series with the VAC source will avoid short-

          INTRODUCTION                                                                One-Port and Two-Port
          A general network having two pairs of terminals, one often labeled          Networks
          the “input terminals’’ and the other the “output terminals,’’ is a
          very important building block in electronic systems, communica-             Admittance (y) Parameters

          and leaves via the output terminals. The output terminal pair may           Hybrid (h) Parameters
          very well connect with the input terminal pair of another network.
          When we studied the concept of Thévenin and Norton equivalent               Transmission (t) Parameters
          networks in Chap. 5, we were introduced to the idea that it is not
          always necessary to know the detailed workings of part of a circuit.        Transformation Methods
          This chapter extends such concepts to linear networks, resulting in         Between y, z, h, and t
          parameters that allow us to predict how any network will interact           Parameters
          with other networks.

                                                                                      Using Network Parameters
          17.1       ONE-PORT NETWORKS
                 •
          A pair of terminals at which a signal may enter or leave a network
          is called a port, and a network having only one such pair of terminals
          is called a one-port network, or simply a one-port. No connections
          may be made to any other nodes internal to the one-port, and it is
          therefore evident that ia must equal ib in the one-port shown in
          Fig. 17.1a. When more than one pair of terminals is present, the
          network is known as a multiport network. The two-port network to
          which this chapter is principally devoted is shown in Fig. 17.1b. The
          currents in the two leads making up each port must be equal, and so it
          follows that i a = i b and i c = i d in the two-port shown in Fig. 17.1b.
          Sources and loads must be connected directly across the two termi-
          nals of a port if the methods of this chapter are to be used. In other

                      ia                               words, each port can be connected only to a one-port network or to a port of
                                                       another multiport network. For example, no device may be connected
                                                       between terminals a and c of the two-port network in Fig. 17.1b. If such a cir-
                                                       cuit must be analyzed, general loop or nodal equations should be written.
                                                           Some of the introductory study of one- and two-port networks is ac-

                                                       Here N loops have been assumed, the currents appear in subscript order in
                                                       each equation, and the order of the equations is the same as that of the cur-

                                                           The use of minor notation (Appendix 2) allows for the input or driving-

                  the reference at the bottom node, and then write the system admittance

                     Exercises 9 and 10 at the end of the chapter give one-ports that can be
                 built using operational amplifiers. These exercises illustrate that negative
                 resistances may be obtained from networks whose only passive circuit
                 elements are resistors, and that inductors may be simulated with only resis-
                 tors and capacitors.

                        •
                 Let us now turn our attention to two-port networks. We will assume in all
                 that follows that the network is composed of linear elements and contains
                 no independent sources; dependent sources are permissible, however. Fur-
                 ther conditions will also be placed on the network in some special cases.

where the y’s are no more than proportionality constants, or unknown coef-
ficients, for the present. However, it should be clear that their dimensions
must be A/V, or S. They are therefore called the y (or admittance) param-
eters, and are defined by Eqs. [5] and [6].
    The y parameters, as well as other sets of parameters we will define later
in the chapter, are represented concisely as matrices. Here, we define the
(2 × 1) column matrix I,

Thus, we may write the matrix equation I = yV, or                                         clear from the context in which it is used.

These (2 × 1) matrices must be equal, element by element, and thus we are
led to the defining equations, [5] and [6].
    The most useful and informative way to attach a physical meaning to the
y parameters is through a direct inspection of Eqs. [5] and [6]. Consider
Eq. [5], for example; if we let V2 be zero, then we see that y11 must be given
by the ratio of I1 to V1. We therefore describe y11 as the admittance measured
at the input terminals with the output terminals short-circuited (V2 = 0).
Since there can be no question which terminals are short-circuited, y11 is
best described as the short-circuit input admittance. Alternatively, we might
describe y11 as the reciprocal of the input impedance measured with the out-
put terminals short-circuited, but a description as an admittance is obviously
more direct. It is not the name of the parameter that is important. Rather, it

    In general, it is easier to use Eq. [10], [11], [12], or [13] when only one
parameter is desired. If we need all of them, however, it is usually easier to
assign V1 and V2 to the input and output nodes, to assign other node-to-
reference voltages at any interior nodes, and then to carry through with the
general solution.
    In order to see what use might be made of such a system of equations,
let us now terminate each port with some specific one-port network.

      ■ FIGURE 17.11 The resistive two-port network of Fig. 17.9, terminated
        with specific one-port networks.

      Consider the simple two-port network of Example 17.4, shown in
      Fig. 17.11 with a practical current source connected to the input port and a
      resistive load connected to the output port. A relationship must now exist
      between V1 and I1 that is independent of the two-port network. This rela-
      tionship may be determined solely from this external circuit. If we apply
      KCL (or write a single nodal equation) at the input,
                                            I1 = 15 − 0.1V1
      For the output, Ohm’s law yields
                                             I2 = −0.25V2
      Substituting these expressions for I1 and I2 in Eqs. [14] and [15], we have
                                        15 = 0.4V1 − 0.1V2
                                         0 = −0.1V1 + 0.4V2
      from which are obtained
                                      V1 = 40 V           V2 = 10 V
      The input and output currents are also easily found:
                                      I1 = 11 A          I2 = −2.5 A
      and the complete terminal characteristics of this resistive two-port are then
      known.
           The advantages of two-port analysis do not show up very strongly for
      such a simple example, but it should be apparent that once the y parameters
      are determined for a more complicated two-port, the performance of the
      two-port for different terminal conditions is easily determined; it is neces-
      sary only to relate V1 to I1 at the input and V2 to I2 at the output.
           In the example just concluded, y12 and y21 were both found to be −0.1 S.
      It is not difficult to show that this equality is also obtained if three general
      impedances ZA, ZB, and ZC are contained in this  network. It is somewhat
      more difficult to determine the specific conditions which are necessary in
      order that y12 = y21 , but the use of determinant notation is of some help. Let
      us see if the relationships of Eqs. [10] to [13] can be expressed in terms of
      the impedance determinant and its minors.
           Since our concern is with the two-port and not with the specific net-
      works with which it is terminated, we will let V1 and V2 be represented by
      two ideal voltage sources. Equation [10] is applied by letting V2  0 (thus
      short-circuiting the output) and finding the input admittance. The network
      now, however, is simply a one-port, and the input impedance of a one-port
      was found in Sec. 17.1. We select loop 1 to include the input terminals, and
      let I1 be that loop’s current; we identify (−I2 ) as the loop current in loop 2

and assign the remaining loop currents in any convenient manner. Thus,

and, therefore,
                                        11
                               y11 =
                                        Z
Similarly,
                                        22
                               y22 =
                                        Z
In order to find y12, we let V1  0 and find I1 as a function of V2. We find
that I1 is given by the ratio

                                        Z
In a similar manner, we may show that

                                                                   This equality of Zij and Zji is evident for the three familiar passive
                                                               elements—the resistor, capacitor, and inductor—and it is also true for

                                                               may wish to include inside a two-port network. Specifically, it is not true in

                                                               and this property is glorified by stating it as the reciprocity theorem:

  Another way of stating the theorem is to say that the          In any passive linear bilateral network, if the single voltage source Vx
  interchange of an ideal voltage source and an ideal            in branch x produces the current response Iy in branch y, then the

17.3         SOME EQUIVALENT NETWORKS
         •
When analyzing electronic circuits, it is often necessary to replace the
active device (and perhaps some of its associated passive circuitry) with an
equivalent two-port containing only three or four impedances. The validity
of the equivalent may be restricted to small signal amplitudes and a single
frequency, or perhaps a limited range of frequencies. The equivalent is also
a linear approximation of a nonlinear circuit. However, if we are faced with
a network containing a number of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, plus a
transistor labeled 2N3823, then we cannot analyze the circuit by any of
the techniques we have studied previously; the transistor must first be re-
placed by a linear model, just as we replaced the op amp by a linear model
in Chap. 6. The y parameters provide one such model in the form of a two-
port network that is often used at high frequencies. Another common linear
model for a transistor appears in Sec. 17.5.
    The two equations that determine the short-circuit admittance parameters,
                                  I1 = y11 V1 + y12 V2                           [16]
                                  I2 = y21 V1 + y22 V2                           [17]
have the form of a pair of nodal equations written for a circuit containing two
nonreference nodes. The determination of an equivalent circuit that leads to
Eqs. [16] and [17] is made more difficult by the inequality, in general, of y12
and y21; it helps to resort to a little trickery in order to obtain a pair of equa-
tions that possess equal mutual coefficients. Let us both add and subtract
y12 V1 (the term we would like to see present on the right side of Eq. [17]):
                         I2 = y12 V1 + y22 V2 + (y21 − y12 )V1                   [18]
or
                         I2 − (y21 − y12 )V1 = y12 V1 + y22 V2                   [19]
The right-hand sides of Eqs. [16] and [19] now show the proper symmetry
for a bilateral circuit; the left-hand side of Eq. [19] may be interpreted as the
algebraic sum of two current sources, one an independent source I2 entering
node 2, and the other a dependent source (y21 − y12 )V1 leaving node 2.
    Let us now “read’’ the equivalent network from Eqs. [16] and [19]. We
first provide a reference node, and then a node labeled V1 and one labeled V2.

These equations enable us to transform easily between the equivalent Y and
 networks, a process known as the Y- transformation (or -T transfor-
mation if the networks are drawn in the forms of those letters). In going
from Y to , Eqs. [20] to [22], first find the value of the common numera-
tor as the sum of the products of the impedances in the Y taken two at a
time. Each impedance in the  is then found by dividing the numerator by
the impedance of that element in the Y which has no common node with the
desired  element. Conversely, given the , first take the sum of the three
impedances around the ; then divide the product of the two  impedances
having a common node with the desired Y element by that sum.
    These transformations are often useful in simplifying passive networks,
particularly resistive ones, thus avoiding the need for any mesh or nodal
analysis.

702              CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS



                  We first make a -Y transformation on the upper  appearing in
                  Fig. 17.15a. The sum of the three resistances forming this  is
                  1 + 4 + 3 = 8 . The product of the two resistors connected to the
                  top node is 1 × 4 = 4 2 . Thus, the upper resistor of the Y is 48 , or 12 .
                  Repeating this procedure for the other two resistors, we obtain the
                  network shown in Fig. 17.15b.
                     We next make the series and parallel combinations indicated,
                  obtaining in succession Fig. 17.15c and d. Thus, the input resistance
                  of the circuit in Fig. 17.15a is found to be 159
                                                               71 , or 2.24
                                                                            .




                    Now let us tackle a slightly more complicated example, shown as
                 Fig. 17.16. We note that the circuit contains a dependent source, and thus the
                 Y- transformation is not applicable.




  EXAMPLE 17.7
                  The circuit shown in Fig. 17.16 is an approximate linear equivalent
                  of a transistor amplifier in which the emitter terminal is the bottom
                  node, the base terminal is the upper input node, and the collector
                  terminal is the upper output node. A 2000  resistor is connected
                  between collector and base for some special application and makes
                  the analysis of the circuit more difficult. Determine the y param-
                  eters for this circuit.

                                emitter configuration with resistive feedback between collector and base.


                  Identify the goal of the problem.
                    Cutting through the problem-specific jargon, we realize that we have
                    been presented with a two-port network and require the y parameters.
                  Collect the known information.
                    Figure 17.16 shows a two-port network with V1, I1, V2, and I2 already
                    indicated, and a value for each component has been provided.
                  Devise a plan.
                    There are several ways we might think about this circuit. If we
                    recognize it as being in the form of the equivalent circuit shown in
                    Fig. 17.13a, then we may immediately determine the values of the
                    y parameters. If recognition is not immediate, then the y parameters
                                          SECTION 17.3 SOME EQUIVALENT NETWORKS   703


  may be determined for the two-port by applying the relationships of
  Eqs. [10] to [13]. We also might avoid any use of two-port analysis
  methods and write equations directly for the circuit as it stands. The
  first option seems best in this case.
 Construct an appropriate set of equations.
  By inspection, we find that −y21 corresponds to the admittance of
  our 2 k resistor, that y11 + y12 corresponds to the admittance of the
  500  resistor, the gain of the dependent current source corresponds
  to y21 − y12 , and finally that y22 + y12 corresponds to the admittance
  of the 10 k resistor. Hence we may write
                                    1
                           y12 = − 2000
                                  1
                           y11 = 500 − y12
                           y21 = 0.0395 + y12
                                   1
                           y22 = 10,000 − y12

 Determine if additional information is required.
  With the equations written as they are, we see that once y12 is com-
  puted, the remaining y parameters may also be obtained.
 Attempt a solution.
  Plugging the numbers into a calculator, we find that
                               1
                    y12 = − 2000 = −0.5 mS
                           1
                                  1 
                    y11 = 500  − − 2000   = 2.5 mS
                             1
                                       1
                                          
                    y22 = 10,000 − − 2000   = 0.6 mS
  and
                                  1 
                   y21 = 0.0395 + − 2000 = 39 mS
  The following equations must then apply:
                          I1 = 2.5V1 − 0.5V2                            [26]
                          I2 = 39V1 + 0.6V2                             [27]
  where we are now using units of mA, V, and mS or k.
 Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
  Writing two nodal equations directly from the circuit, we find
                V1 − V2   V1
         I1 =           +           or       I1 = 2.5V1 − 0.5V2
                   2      0.5
  and
                      V2 − V1   V2
    −39.5V1 + I2 =            +            or      I2 = 39V1 + 0.6V2
                         2      10
  which agree with Eqs. [26] and [27] obtained directly from the
  y parameters.
704   CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS


          Now let us make use of Eqs. [26] and [27] by analyzing the performance
      of the two-port in Fig. 17.16 under several different operating conditions.
      We first provide a current source of 1/0◦ mA at the input and connect a
      0.5 k (2 mS) load to the output. The terminating networks are therefore
      both one-ports and give us the following specific information relating I1 to
      V1 and I2 to V2:
                          I1 = 1 (for any V1 )        I2 = −2V2
      We now have four equations in the four variables, V1, V2, I1, and I2. Sub-
      stituting the two one-port relationships in Eqs. [26] and [27], we obtain two
      equations relating V1 and V2:
                      1 = 2.5V1 − 0.5V2           0 = 39V1 + 2.6V2
      Solving, we find that
                              V1 = 0.1 V         V2 = −1.5 V
                              I1 = 1 mA          I2 = 3 mA
      These four values apply to the two-port operating with a prescribed input
      (I1  1 mA) and a specified load (R L = 0.5 k).
          The performance of an amplifier is often described by giving a few spe-
      cific values. Let us calculate four of these values for this two-port with its
      terminations. We will define and evaluate the voltage gain, the current gain,
      the power gain, and the input impedance.
          The voltage gain GV is
                                                 V2
                                         GV =
                                                 V1
      From the numerical results, it is easy to see that GV = −15.
         The current gain GI is defined as
                                                 I2
                                          GI =
                                                 I1
      and we have
                                             GI = 3
      Let us define and calculate the power gain GP for an assumed sinusoidal
      excitation. We have
                                     Pout   Re − 12 V2 I∗2
                          GP =            =                = 45
                                     Pin     Re 12 V1 I∗1
      The device might be termed either a voltage, a current, or a power amplifier,
      since all the gains are greater than unity. If the 2 k resistor were removed,
      the power gain would rise to 354.
          The input and output impedances of the amplifier are often desired in or-
      der that maximum power transfer may be achieved to or from an adjacent
      two-port. We define the input impedance Zin as the ratio of input voltage to
      current:
                                             V1
                                     Zin =      = 0.1 k
                                             I1
                                                  SECTION 17.3 SOME EQUIVALENT NETWORKS   705

This is the impedance offered to the current source when the 500  load is
connected to the output. (With the output short-circuited, the input imped-
ance is necessarily 1/y11 , or 400 .)
    It should be noted that the input impedance cannot be determined by
replacing every source with its internal impedance and then combining
resistances or conductances. In the given circuit, such a procedure would
yield a value of 416 . The error, of course, comes from treating the
dependent source as an independent source. If we think of the input imped-
ance as being numerically equal to the input voltage produced by an input
current of 1 A, the application of the 1 A source produces some input volt-
age V1, and the strength of the dependent source (0.0395V1) cannot be zero.
We should recall that when we obtain the Thévenin equivalent impedance
of a circuit containing a dependent source along with one or more indepen-
dent sources, we must replace the independent sources with short circuits or
open circuits, but a dependent source must not be deactivated. Of course, if
the voltage or current on which the dependent source depends is zero, then
the dependent source will itself be inactive; occasionally a circuit may be
simplified by recognizing such an occurrence.
    Besides GV, GI, GP, and Zin , there is one other performance parameter
that is quite useful. This is the output impedance Zout , and it is determined
for a different circuit configuration.
    The output impedance is just another term for the Thévenin impedance
appearing in the Thévenin equivalent circuit of that portion of the network
faced by the load. In our circuit, which we have assumed is driven by a
1/0◦ mA current source, we therefore replace this independent source with
an open circuit, leave the dependent source alone, and seek the input im-
pedance seen looking to the left from the output terminals (with the load
removed). Thus, we define
     Zout = V2 |I2 =1 A with all other independent sources deactivated and R L removed
We therefore remove the load resistor, apply 1/0◦ mA (since we are work-
ing in V, mA, and k) at the output terminals, and determine V2. We place
these requirements on Eqs. [26] and [27], and obtain
                 0 = 2.5V1 − 0.5V2               1 = 39V1 + 0.6V2
Solving,
                                   V2 = 0.1190 V
and thus
                                  Zout = 0.1190 k
    An alternative procedure might be to find the open-circuit output volt-
age and the short-circuit output current. That is, the Thévenin impedance is
the output impedance:
                                                    V2oc
                                Zout = Zth = −
                                                    I2sc
Carrying out this procedure, we first rekindle the independent source so that
I1  1 mA, and then open-circuit the load so that I2  0. We have
                 1 = 2.5V1 − 0.5V2               0 = 39V1 + 0.6V2

                                                               When we first defined a port in Sec. 17.1, we noted that the currents enter-

                                                               parallel connection shown in Fig. 17.18 violates this condition. However, if
                                                               each two-port has a reference node that is common to its input and output

      17.4       IMPEDANCE PARAMETERS
             •
      The concept of two-port parameters has been introduced in terms of the
      short-circuit admittance parameters. There are other sets of parameters,
      however, and each set is associated with a particular class of networks for
      which its use provides the simplest analysis. We will consider three other
      types of parameters, the open-circuit impedance parameters, which are the
      subject of this section; and the hybrid and the transmission parameters,
      which are discussed in following sections.
         We begin again with a general linear two-port that does not contain any
      independent sources; the currents and voltages are assigned as before
      (Fig. 17.8). Now let us consider the voltage V1 as the response produced by
      two current sources I1 and I2. We thus write for V1
                                       V1 = z11 I1 + z12 I2                       [29]
      and for V2
                                       V2 = z21 I1 + z22 I2                       [30]
      or
                                                                         
                                  V1                    z11   z12        I1
                        V=                 = zI =                                 [31]
                                  V2                    z21   z22        I2

      Of course, in using these equations it is not necessary that I1 and I2 be
      current sources; nor is it necessary that V1 and V2 be voltage sources. In
      general, we may have any networks terminating the two-port at either end.
      As the equations are written, we probably think of V1 and V2 as given quan-
      tities, or independent variables, and I1 and I2 as unknowns, or dependent
      variables.
           The six ways in which two equations may be written to relate these four
      quantities define the different systems of parameters. We study the four
      most important of these six systems of parameters.
           The most informative description of the z parameters, defined in
      Eqs. [29] and [30], is obtained by setting each of the currents equal to zero.

      Since zero current results from an open-circuit termination, the z param-
      eters are known as the open-circuit impedance parameters. They are easily
      related to the short-circuit admittance parameters by solving Eqs. [29] and

In a similar manner, the z parameters may be expressed in terms of the
admittance parameters. Transformations of this nature are possible between
any of the various parameter systems, and quite a collection of occasionally
useful formulas may be obtained. Transformations between the y and z pa-
rameters (as well as the h and t parameters which we will consider in the
following sections) are given in Table 17.1 as a helpful reference.

                                                                If the two-port is a bilateral network, reciprocity is present; it is easy to
                                                            show that this results in the equality of z12 and z21.
                                                                Equivalent circuits may again be obtained from an inspection of

                                                                Let us leave the derivation of such an equivalent to some leisure
                                                            moment, and consider next an example of a rather general nature. Can we
                                                            construct a general Thévenin equivalent of the two-port, as viewed from
                                                            the output terminals? It is necessary first to assume a specific input circuit
                                                            configuration, and we will select an independent voltage source Vs (positive

                                                            and obtain

                                                             with a 500  resistor, and terminated in a 10 k load resistor.

 and the characterizing equations of the input and output networks are
                             Vs = 500I1 + V1                              [38]

 From these last four equations, we may easily obtain expressions for
 V1, I1, V2, and I2 in terms of Vs:
                                                     Vs
                        V1 = 0.75Vs          I1 =

                                    I1
 The output impedance may be obtained by referring to Fig. 17.21:
                                     z12 z21
                     Zout = z22 −            = 16.67 k
                                    z11 + Zg
 In accordance with the predictions of the maximum power transfer
 theorem, the power gain reaches a maximum value when Z L = Z∗out =
 16.67 k; that maximum value is 17,045.


     The y parameters are useful when two-ports are interconnected in paral-
lel, and, in a dual manner, the z parameters simplify the problem of a series
connection of networks, shown in Fig. 17.22. Note that the series connection
is not the same as the cascade connection that we will discuss later in con-
nection with the transmission parameters. If each two-port has a common
reference node for its input and output, and if the references are connected
together as indicated in Fig. 17.22, then I1 flows through the input ports of
the two networks in series. A similar statement holds for I2. Thus, ports
remain ports after the interconnection. It follows that I = I A = I B and

                       V = VA + VB = z AI A + zB IB
                         = (z A + z B )I = zI

17.5       HYBRID PARAMETERS
       •
The difficulty in measuring quantities such as the open-circuit impedance
parameters arises when a parameter such as z21 must be measured. A known
sinusoidal current is easily supplied at the input terminals, but because of
the exceedingly high output impedance of the transistor circuit, it is difficult
to open-circuit the output terminals and yet supply the necessary dc biasing
voltages and measure the sinusoidal output voltage. A short-circuit current
measurement at the output terminals is much simpler to implement.
    The hybrid parameters are defined by writing the pair of equations relat-
ing V1, I1, V2, and I2 as if V1 and I2 were the independent variables:
                            V1 = h11 I1 + h12 V2                                [40]
                             I2 = h21 I1 + h22 V2                               [41]
or

                                  I2          V2
The nature of the parameters is made clear by first setting V2 = 0. Thus,
                         
                   V1 
           h11 =             = short-circuit input impedance
                   I1 V2 =0
                       
                   I2 
           h21 =            = short-circuit forward current gain
                   I1 V2 =0
Letting I1 = 0, we obtain
                       
                   V1 
            h12 =            = open-circuit reverse voltage gain
                   V2 I1 =0
                       
                   I2 
            h22 =            = open-circuit output admittance
                   V2 I1 =0
Since the parameters represent an impedance, an admittance, a voltage gain,
and a current gain, they are called the “hybrid’’ parameters.
    The subscript designations for these parameters are often simplified
when they are applied to transistors. Thus, h11, h12, h21, and h22 become hi,
hr, hf, and ho, respectively, where the subscripts denote input, reverse, for-
ward, and output.


                                                                                                              EXAMPLE 17.9

 output current is easily obtained by current division: I2 = −0.4 A; thus,
 h21 = −0.4.
    The remaining two parameters are obtained with the input open-                      ■ FIGURE 17.24 A bilateral network for which the h

        The response at the input terminals is 0.4 V (V1 = 0.4 V), and thus
        h12  0.4. The current delivered by this source at the output terminals
        is 0.1 A (I2 = 0.1 A), and therefore

          The circuit shown in Fig. 17.26 is a direct translation of the two defining
      equations, [40] and [41]. The first represents KVL about the input loop,
      while the second is obtained from KCL at the upper output node. This
      circuit is also a popular transistor equivalent circuit. Let us assume some
      reasonable values for the common-emitter configuration: h11 = 1200 ,
      h12 = 2 × 10−4 , h21 = 50, h22 = 50 × 10−6 S, a voltage generator of
      1/0◦ mV in series with 800 , and a 5 k load. For the input,
                                10−3 = (1200 + 800)I1 + 2 × 10−4 V2
      and at the output,

    The three terminals of a transistor are labeled the
base (b), collector (c), and emitter (e) as shown in
Fig. 17.28, and are named after their roles in the trans-
port of charge within the device. The h parameters of a
bipolar junction transistor are typically measured with
the emitter terminal grounded, also known as the
common-emitter configuration; the base is then desig-
nated as the input and the collector as the output. As
mentioned previously, however, the transistor is a non-
linear device, and so definition of h parameters which

                                                                                                  +
                                                                                        1V        –
                                                                                                                     10 Ω
We therefore short-circuit the output (V2 = 0) and set V1  1 V, as shown in
Fig. 17.30b. Note that we cannot set the denominator equal to unity by plac-
ing a 1 A current source at the output; we already have a short circuit there.                                (b)
The equivalent resistance offered to the 1 V source is Req = 2 + (410) ,
and we then use current division to get                                              ■ FIGURE 17.30 (a) A two-port resistive network

Hence,
                                   1    34
                         t12 =        =    = 6.8 
                                  −I2   5

    If it is necessary to find all four parameters, we write any convenient
pair of equations using all four terminal quantities, V1, V2, I1, and I2. From
Fig. 17.30a, we have two mesh equations:
                              V1 = 12I1 + 10I2                               [47]
                              V2 = 10I1 + 14I2                               [48]
Solving Eq. [48] for I1, we get
                             I1 = 0.1V2 − 1.4I2
so that t21 = 0.1 S and t22 = 1.4. Substituting the expression for I1 in
Eq. [47], we find
             V1 = 12(0.1V2 − 1.4I2 ) + 10I2 = 1.2V2 − 6.8I2
and t11  1.2 and t12 = 6.8 , once again.
   For reciprocal networks, the determinant of the t matrix is equal to unity:
                           t = t11 t22 − t12 t21 = 1

                      We conclude our two-port discussion by connecting two two-ports in

                  currents are indicated for each two-port, and the corresponding t parameter

The characterization of two-port networks using t parameters creates
the opportunity for vastly simplified analysis of cascaded two-port
network circuits. As seen in this section, where, for example,
                                              
                                 1.2     6.8 
                         tA =
                                 0.1 S 1.4
and
                                                                

                                  tB =
                                       0.05 S  1.4
we found that the t parameters characterizing the cascaded network can
be found by simply multiplying tA and tB:
                                              t  tA  tB
Such matrix operations are easily carried out using scientific calculators
or software packages such as MATLAB. The MATLAB script,
                                                                       (Continued on next page)
720   CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS



       for example, would be
                             EDU» tA = [1.2 6.8; 0.1 1.4];
                             EDU» tB = [1.2 13.6; 0.05 1.4];
                             EDU» t = tA*tB
                             t=
                                1.7800      25.8400
                                0.1900      3.3200

       as we found in Example 17.10.
          In terms of entering matrices in MATLAB, each has a case-sensitive
       variable name (tA, tB, and t in this example). Matrix elements are en-
       tered a row at a time, beginning with the top row; rows are separated by
       a semicolon. Again, the reader should always be careful to remember
       that the order to operations is critical when performing matrix algebra.
       For example, tB*tA results in a totally different matrix than the one we
       sought:
                                                      
                                             2.8 27.2
                                 tB  tA 
                                             0.2 2.3

       For simple matrices such as seen in this example, a scientific calculator
       is just as handy (if not more so). However, larger cascaded networks
       are more easily handled on a computer, where it is more convenient to
       see all arrays on the screen simultaneously.




      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      In this chapter we encountered a somewhat abstract way to represent net-
      works. This new approach is especially useful if the network is passive, and
      will either be connected somehow to other networks at some point, or
      perhaps component values will frequently be changed. We introduced the
      concept through the idea of a one-port network, where all we really did was
      determine the Thévenin equivalent resistance (or impedance, more generally
      speaking). Our first exposure to the idea of a two-port network (perhaps one
      port is an input, the other an output?) was through admittance parameters,
      also called y parameters. The result is a matrix which, when multiplied by
      the vector containing the terminal voltages, yields a vector with the currents
      into each port. A little manipulation yielded what we called -Y equivalents
      in Chap. 5. The direct counterpart to y parameters are z parameters, where
      each matrix element is the ratio of a voltage to a current. Occasionally y and
      z parameters are not particularly convenient, so we also introduced
      “hybrid” or h parameters, as well as “transmission” or t parameters, also
      referred to as ABCD parameters.
          Table 17.1 summarizes the conversion process between y, z, h, and
      t parameters; having one set of parameters which completely describes a
      network is sufficent regardless of what type of matrix we prefer for a partic-
      ular analysis.

   As a convenience to the reader, we will now proceed directly to a list of
key concepts in the chapter, along with correponding examples.
❑ In order to employ the analysis methods described in this chapter, it is
   critical to remember that each port can only be connected to either a
   one-port network or a port of another multiport network.
❑ The input impedance of a one-port (passive) linear network can be
   obtained using either nodal or mesh analysis; in some instances the set
   of coefficients can be written directly by inspection. (Examples 17.1,
   17.2, 17.3)
❑ The defining equations for analyzing a two-port network in terms of its
   admittance (y) parameters are:
             I1 = y11 V1 + y12 V2       and       I2 = y21 V1 + y22 V2
    where
                                                           

20. The metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), a three-
    terminal nonlinear element used in many electronics applications, is often
    specified in terms of its y parameters. The ac parameters are strongly
    dependent on the measurement conditions, and commonly named yis , yrs ,
    y f s , and yos , as in
                                Ig = yisVgs + yrsVds                                 [49]

   where Ig is the transistor gate current, Id is the transistor drain current, and the
   third terminal (the source) is common to the input and output during the mea-
   surement. Thus, Vgs is the voltage between the gate and the source, and Vds is
   the voltage between the drain and the source. The typical high-frequency
   model used to approximate the behavior of a MOSFET is shown in Fig. 17.48.

          We know that the complete response of a linear circuit to an arbi-
          trary forcing function is composed of the sum of a forced response
          and a natural response. The natural response has been considered

                                                                                                             733

      both in the time domain (Chaps. 7, 8, and 9) and in the frequency domain
      (Chaps. 14 and 15). The forced response has also been considered from sev-
      eral perspectives, including the phasor-based techniques of Chap. 10. As we
      have discovered, in some cases we need both components of the total re-
      sponse of a particular circuit, while in others we need only the natural or the
      forced response. In this section, we refocus our attention on forcing func-
      tions that are sinusoidal in nature, and discover how to write a general peri-
      odic function as a sum of such functions—leading us into a discussion of a
      new set of circuit analysis procedures.

      Harmonics
      Some feeling for the validity of representing a general periodic function by an
      infinite sum of sine and cosine functions may be gained by considering a sim-
      ple example. Let us first assume a cosine function of radian frequency ω0 ,
                                       v1 (t) = 2 cos ω0 t
      where
                                            ω0 = 2π f 0
      and the period T is
                                                1    2π
                                        T =        =
                                                f0   ω0
      Although T does not usually carry a zero subscript, it is the period of the
      fundamental frequency. The harmonics of this sinusoid have frequencies
      nω0 , where ω0 is the fundamental frequency and n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . The
      frequency of the first harmonic is the fundamental frequency.
          Next let us select a third-harmonic voltage
                                       v3a (t) = cos 3ω0 t
      The fundamental v1 (t), the third harmonic v3a (t), and the sum of these two
      waves are shown as functions of time in Fig. 18.1a. Note that the sum is also
      periodic, with period T = 2π/ω0 .
          The form of the resultant periodic function changes as the phase and
      amplitude of the third-harmonic component change. Thus, Fig. 18.1b shows
      the effect of combining v1 (t)and a third harmonic of slightly larger amplitude,
                                     v3b (t) = 1.5 cos 3ω0 t
      By shifting the phase of the third harmonic by 90 degrees to give
                                       v3c (t) = sin 3ω0 t
      the sum, shown in Fig. 18.1c, takes on a still different character. In all cases,
      the period of the resultant waveform is the same as the period of the funda-
      mental waveform. The nature of the waveform depends on the amplitude
      and phase of every possible harmonic component, and we will find that
      we are able to generate waveforms which have extremely nonsinusoidal
      characteristics by an appropriate combination of sinusoidal functions.
          After we have become familiar with the use of the sum of an infinite
      number of sine and cosine functions to represent a periodic waveform, we
      will consider the frequency-domain representation of a general nonperiodic
      waveform in a manner similar to the Laplace transform.

The Fourier Series

tional relationship

Evaluation of the Fourier Coefficients
The evaluation of the unknown constants in the Fourier series may now be
accomplished readily. We first attack a0. If we integrate each side of Eq. [1]
over a full period, we obtain
      T              T          T ∞
          f (t) dt =     a0 dt +         (an cos nω0 t + bn sin nω0 t) dt
      0                0             0    n=1
But every term in the summation is of the form of Eq. [2] or [3], and thus
                           T
                               f (t) dt = a0 T
                               0

or
                                          T
                                     1
                              a0 =                f (t) dt                         [9]
                                     T       0

This constant a0 is simply the average value of f (t) over a period, and we
therefore describe it as the dc component of f (t).
    To evaluate one of the cosine coefficients, for example, ak, the coefficient
of cos kω0 t, we first multiply each side of Eq. [1] by cos kω0 t and then
integrate both sides of the equation over a full period:
          T                        T
              f (t) cos kω0 t dt =     a0 cos kω0 t dt
          0                          0
                                          T
                                            ∞
                                   +                   an cos kω0 t cos nω0 t dt
                                         0       n=1
                                          T ∞
                                            
                                   +                   bn cos kω0 t sin nω0 t dt
                                         0       n=1

From Eqs. [3], [4], and [6] we note that every term on the right-hand side of
this equation is zero except for the single an term where k = n. We evaluate
that term using Eq. [8], and in so doing we find ak, or an:
                                 
                              2 T
                        an =           f (t) cos nω0 t dt                [10]

738              CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS


                 This result is twice the average value of the product f (t) cos nω0 t over a
                 period.
                    In a similar way, we obtain bk by multiplying by sin kω0 t, integrating
                 over a period, noting that all but one of the terms on the right-hand side are
                 zero, and performing that single integration by Eq. [7]. The result is
                                                  
                                                2 T
                                         bn =          f (t) sin nω0 t dt                  [11]

                 which is twice the average value of f (t) sin nω0 t over a period.
                     Equations [9] to [11] now enable us to determine values for a0 and all
                 the an and bn in the Fourier series, Eq. [1], as summarized below:

  EXAMPLE 18.1
                  The “half-sinusoidal” waveform shown in Fig. 18.2 represents the
                  voltage response obtained at the output of a half-wave rectifier
                  circuit, a nonlinear circuit whose purpose is to convert a sinusoidal
                  input voltage to a (pulsating) approximation to dc. Find the Fourier
                  series representation of this waveform.

                  Identify the goal of the problem.
                    We are presented with a periodic function and are asked to find the
                    Fourier series representation. If not for the removal of all negative
                    voltages, the problem would be trivial, as only one sinusoid would be
                    required.

 Collect the known information.
  In order to represent this voltage as a Fourier series, we must first
  determine the period and then express the graphical voltage as an
  analytical function of time. From the graph, the period is seen to be
                                T = 0.4 s
  and thus
                               f 0 = 2.5 Hz
  and
                              ω0 = 5π rad/s
 Devise a plan.
  The most straightforward approach is to apply Eqs. [9] to [11] to
  calculate the set of coefficients a0, an, and bn. To do this, we need a
  functional expression for v(t), the most straightforward being defined
  over the interval t = 0 to t = 0.4 as
                         ⎧
                         ⎨ Vm cos 5πt        0 ≤ t ≤ 0.1
                 v(t) = 0                    0.1 ≤ t ≤ 0.3
                         ⎩
                            Vm cos 5πt       0.3 ≤ t ≤ 0.4
  However, choosing the period to extend from t = −0.1 to t = 0.3
  will result in fewer equations and, hence, fewer integrals:
                        
                          Vm cos 5πt     −0.1 ≤ t ≤ 0.1
                 v(t) =                                           [12]
                          0                0.1 ≤ t ≤ 0.3
  This form is preferable, although either description will yield the
  correct results.
 Construct an appropriate set of equations.
  The zero-frequency component is easily obtained:                                  Notice that integration over an entire period must be
               0.3                0.1                  0.3
          1                    1                                                    broken up into subintervals of the period, in each of
    a0 =            v(t) dt =           Vm cos 5πt dt +       0 dt                  which the functional form of v (t ) is known.
         0.4 −0.1             0.4 −0.1                   0.1

  The amplitude of a general cosine term is
                           0.1
                       2
                an =            Vm cos 5πt cos 5πnt dt
                      0.4 −0.1
  and the amplitude of a general sine term is
                            0.1
                        2
                 bn =            Vm cos 5πt sin 5πnt dt
                       0.4 −0.1
  which, in fact, is always zero, and hence will not be considered further.
 Determine if additional information is required.
  The form of the function we obtain upon integrating is different when
  n is unity than it is for any other choice of n. If n = 1, we have

Line and Phase Spectra
We depicted the function v(t) of Example 18.1 graphically in Fig. 18.2, and
analytically in Eq. [12]—both representations being in the time domain. The
Fourier series representation of v(t) given in Eq. [16] is also a time-domain
expression, but may be transformed into a frequency-domain representation
as well. For example, Fig. 18.5 shows the amplitude of each frequency
component of v(t), a type of plot known as a line spectrum. Here, the mag-
nitude of each frequency component (i.e., |a0 |, |a1 |, etc.) is indicated by the
length of the vertical line at the corresponding frequency ( f0, f1, etc.); for the
sake of convenience, we have taken Vm = 1. Given a different value of Vm,
we simply scale the y axis values by the new value.

         the first seven frequency components. A magnitude of V m = 1 has been chosen for
         convenience.



           Such a plot, sometimes referred to as a discrete spectrum, gives a great
      deal of information at a glance. In particular, we can see how many terms of
      the series are required to obtain a reasonable approximation of the original
      waveform. In the line spectrum of Fig. 18.5, we note that the 8th and 10th
      harmonics (20 and 25 Hz, respectively) add only a small correction. Trun-
      cating the series after the 6th harmonic therefore should lead to a reasonable
      approximation; the reader can judge this for herself/himself by considering
      Fig. 18.3.
           One note of caution must be injected. The example we have considered
      contains no sine terms, and the amplitude of the nth harmonic is therefore
      |an |. If bn is not zero, then the amplitude of the component at a frequency
      nω0 must be an2 + bn2 . This is the general quantity which we must show in
      a line spectrum. When we discuss the complex form of the Fourier series,
      we will see that this amplitude is obtained more directly.
           In addition to the amplitude spectrum, we may construct a discrete phase
      spectrum. At any frequency nω0 , we combine the cosine and sine terms to
      determine the phase angle φn :
                                                                              

possible to anticipate the absence of certain terms in a Fourier series, before any                        f (t)
integrations are performed, by an inspection of the symmetry of the given time
function. We will investigate the use of symmetry in the following section.

Even and Odd Symmetry
The two types of symmetry which are most readily recognized are even-                                        (a)
function symmetry and odd-function symmetry, or simply even symmetry and
odd symmetry. We say that f (t) possesses the property of even symmetry if                                 f (t)
                                 f (t) = f (−t)                               [17]
Such functions as t 2 , cos 3t, ln(cos t), sin2 7t, and a constant C all possess
even symmetry; the replacement of t by (−t) does not change the value of
                                                                                                                                t
any of these functions. This type of symmetry may also be recognized                           –T             0        T
graphically, for if f (t) = f (−t), then mirror symmetry exists about the
 f (t) axis. The function shown in Fig. 18.6a possesses even symmetry; if the

                                f (t) = − f (−t)                              [18]
In other words, if t is replaced by (−t), then the negative
                                                       √        of the given func-
tion is obtained; for example, t, sin t , t cos 70t , t 1 + t 2 , and the function
sketched in Fig. 18.6b are all odd functions and possess odd symmetry. The
graphical characteristics of odd symmetry are apparent if the portion of
 f (t) for t > 0 is rotated about the positive t axis and the resultant figure is
then rotated about the f (t) axis; the two curves will fit exactly, one on top
of the other. That is, we now have symmetry about the origin, rather than
about the f (t) axis as we did for even functions.
     Having definitions for even and odd symmetry, we should note that the
product of two functions with even symmetry, or of two functions with odd
symmetry, yields a function with even symmetry. Furthermore, the product
of an even and an odd function gives a function with odd symmetry.

Symmetry and Fourier Series Terms
Now let us investigate the effect that even symmetry produces in a Fourier
series. If we think of the expression which equates an even function f (t)
and the sum of an infinite number of sine and cosine functions, then it is
apparent that the sum must also be an even function. A sine wave, however,
is an odd function, and no sum of sine waves can produce any even function
other than zero (which is both even and odd). It is thus plausible that the
Fourier series of any even function is composed of only a constant and
cosine functions. Let us now show carefully that bn = 0. We have

      We replace the variable t in the first integral by −τ, or τ = −t , and make
      use of the fact that f (t) = f (−t) = f (τ ):

      but the symbol we use to identify the variable of integration cannot affect
      the value of the integral. Thus,

      No sine terms are present. Therefore, if f (t) shows even symmetry, then
      bn = 0; conversely, if bn = 0, then f (t) must have even symmetry.
          A similar examination of the expression for an leads to an integral over
      the half period extending from t = 0 to t = 12 T :

                                     T      0


      The fact that an may be obtained for an even function by taking “twice the
      integral over half the range’’ should seem logical.
          A function having odd symmetry can contain no constant term or cosine
      terms in its Fourier expansion. Let us prove the second part of this state-
      ment. We have

      and we now let t = −τ in the first integral:

      But f (−τ ) = − f (τ ), and therefore

                                                an = 0        (odd sym.)                                      [21]

A similar, but simpler, proof shows that
                                    a0 = 0          (odd sym.)
With odd symmetry, therefore, an = 0 and a0 = 0; conversely, if an = 0
and a0 = 0, odd symmetry is present.
   The values of bn may again be obtained by integrating over half the range:

The Fourier series for both of these square waves have one other interesting
characteristic: neither contains any even harmonics.1 That is, the only fre-                                                                                  t

Half-wave symmetry, unlike even and odd symmetry, is not a function
of the choice of the point t = 0. Thus, we can state that the square wave

(1) Constant vigilance is required to avoid confusion between an even function and an even harmonic, or
between an odd function and an odd harmonic. For example, b10 is the coefficient of an even harmonic,
and it is zero if f (t) is an even function.

 Since the response to the dc component is simply 5 V/4  = 1.25 A,
 the forced response may be expressed as the summation

                               5  ∞
                                           sin 2nt    cos 2nt
            i f (t) = 1.25 +                        −
                               π n=1(odd) n(1 + n )
                                                  2   1 + n2

 The familiar natural response of this simple circuit is the single expo-
 nential term [characterizing the single pole of the transfer function,
 I f /Vs = 1/(4 + 2s)]
                                  i n (t) = Ae−2t
 The complete response is therefore the sum
                               i(t) = i f (t) + i n (t)
 Letting t = 0, we find A using i(0) = 0:
                                    5 ∞         1
                     A = −1.25 +
                                    π n=1(odd) 1 + n 2
 Although correct, it is more convenient to use the numerical value of the
 summation. The sum of the first 5 terms of  1/(1 + n 2 ) is 0.671, the
 sum of the first 10 terms is 0.695, the sum of the first 20 terms is 0.708,
 and the exact sum is 0.720 to three significant figures. Thus
                                       5
                    A = −1.25 +          (0.720) = −0.104
                                       π
 and
              i(t) = −0.104e−2t + 1.25

    In obtaining this solution, we have had to use many of the most general
concepts introduced in this and the preceding 17 chapters. Some we did not
have to use because of the simple nature of this particular circuit, but their
places in the general analysis were indicated. In this sense, we may look
upon the solution of this problem as a significant achievement in our intro-
ductory study of circuit analysis. In spite of this glorious feeling of accom-
plishment, however, it must be pointed out that the complete response, as
obtained in Example 18.2 in analytical form, is not of much value as it
stands; it furnishes no clear picture of the nature of the response. What we
really need is a sketch of i(t) as a function of time. This may be obtained by
a laborious calculation at a sufficient number of instants of time; a desktop
computer or a programmable calculator can be of great assistance here. The
sketch may be approximated by the graphical addition of the natural re-
sponse, the dc term, and the first few harmonics; this is an unrewarding task.
    When all is said and done, the most informative solution of this problem
is probably obtained by making a repeated transient analysis. That is, the
form of the response can certainly be calculated in the interval from t = 0
to t = π/2 s; it is an exponential rising toward 2.5 A. After determining the
750                                         CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS


                                            value at the end of this first interval, we have an initial condition for the next
                                            (π/2)-second interval. The process is repeated until the response assumes a
                                            generally periodic nature. The method is eminently suitable to this example,
                                            for there is negligible change in the current waveform in the successive
                                            periods π/2 < t < 3π/2 and 3π/2 < t < 5π/2. The complete current

                                            In obtaining a frequency spectrum, we have seen that the amplitude of each
                                            frequency component depends on both an and bn; that is, the sine term and
                                            the cosine term both contribute to the amplitude. The exact expression for
                                            this amplitude is an2 + bn2 . It is also possible to obtain the amplitude
                                            directly by using a form of Fourier series in which each term is a cosine
                                            function with a phase angle; the amplitude and phase angle are functions of
                                             f (t) and n. An even more convenient and concise form of the Fourier series
                                            is obtained if the sines and cosines are expressed as exponential functions
                                            with complex multiplying constants.
                                                 Let us first take the trigonometric form of the Fourier series:
  The reader may recall the identities                                             
                                                                                   ∞
                                                                  f (t) = a0 +            (an cos nω0 t + bn sin nω0 t)
                           e j α − e− j α
                 sin α =                                                            n=1

  and
                                            and then substitute the exponential forms for the sine and cosine. After
                           e j α + e− j α
                                            rearranging,
                 cos α =
                                                                   ∞                                         

                                                                                    2                    2

We now define a complex constant cn :
                     cn = 12 (an − jbn )           (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .)                    [27]
The values of an, bn, and cn all depend on n and f (t). Suppose we now
replace n with (−n); how do the values of the constants change? The coef-
ficients an and bn are defined by Eqs. [10] and [11], and it is evident that
                                         a−n = an
but
                                        b−n = −bn
From Eq. [27], then,
                    c−n = 12 (an + jbn )               (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .)                [28]
Thus,
                                         cn = c∗−n
We also let
                                          c0 = a0
We may therefore express f (t) as
                                   
                                   ∞                      
                                                          ∞
                    f (t) = c0 +          cn e jnω0 t +          c−n e− jnω0 t
                                   n=1                    n=1

or
                                 
                                 ∞                     
                                                       ∞
                       f (t) =         cn e jnω0 t +         c−n e− jnω0 t
                                 n=0                   n=1

Finally, instead of summing the second series over the positive integers
from 1 to ∞, let us sum over the negative integers from −1 to −∞:
                                 
                                 ∞                       
                                                         −∞
                       f (t) =          cn e jnω0 t +          cn e jnω0 t
                                 n=0                    n=−1

or

                                             
                                             ∞
                                 f (t) =           cn e jnω0 t                             [29]
                                           n=−∞


By agreement, a summation from −∞ to ∞ is understood to include a term
for n = 0.
    Equation [29] is the complex form of the Fourier series for f (t); its con-
ciseness is one of the most important reasons for its use. In order to obtain
the expression by which a particular complex coefficient cn may be evalu-
ated, we substitute Eqs. [10] and [11] in Eq. [27]:
                    T /2                                     T /2
               1                                         1
        cn =                f (t) cos nω0 t dt − j                    f (t) sin nω0 t dt

752      CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS


         and then we use the exponential equivalents of the sine and cosine and
         simplify:
                                                T /2
                                          1
                                   cn =                 f (t)e− jnω0 t dt            [30]
                                          T     −T /2


         Thus, a single concise equation serves to replace the two equations required
         for the trigonometric form of the Fourier series. Instead of evaluating two
         integrals to find the Fourier coefficients, only one integration is required;
         moreover, it is almost always a simpler integration. It should be noted that
         the integral of Eq. [30] contains the multiplying factor 1/T , whereas the in-
         tegrals for an and bn both contain the factor 2/T .
             Collecting the two basic relationships for the exponential form of the
         Fourier series, we have

                                                   
                                                   ∞

         where ω0 = 2π/T as usual.
             The amplitude of the component of the exponential Fourier series at
         ω = nω0 , where n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , is |cn |. We may plot a discrete
         frequency spectrum giving |cn | versus nω0 or nf0, using an abscissa that
         shows both positive and negative values; and when we do this, the graph is
         symmetrical about the origin, since Eqs. [27] and [28] show that |cn | = |c−n |.
             We note also from Eqs. [29] and [30] that the amplitude of the sinusoidal
         component at ω = nω0 , where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , is an2 + bn2 = 2|cn | =
         2|c−n | = |cn | + |c−n |. For the dc component, a0 = c0 .
             The exponential Fourier coefficients, given by Eq. [30], are also affected
         by the presence of certain symmetries in f (t). Thus, appropriate expres-

    We thus find that c0 = 0, c1 = 2/π , c2 = 0, c3 = −2/3π , c4 = 0,
c5 = 2/5π , and so forth. These values agree with the trigonometric
Fourier series given as the answer we obtained in Practice Problem 18.3
for the same waveform shown in Fig. 18.4b if we remember that
an = 2cn when bn = 0.
    Utilizing the symmetry of the waveform (even and half-wave), there
is less work when we apply Eqs. [34a] and [34b], leading to

                 The Sampling Function
                 The trigonometric factor in Eq. [36] occurs frequently in modern communi-
                 cation theory, and it is called the sampling function. The “sampling” refers
                 to the time function of Fig. 18.11 from which the sampling function is
                 derived. The product of this sequence of pulses and any other function f (t)
                                     SECTION 18.4 COMPLEX FORM OF THE FOURIER SERIES   755

represents samples of f (t) every T seconds if τ is small and V0 = 1. We
define
                                           sin x
                                Sa(x) =
                                             x
Because of the way in which it helps to determine the amplitude of the var-
ious frequency components in f (t), it is worth our while to discover the im-
portant characteristics of this function. First, we note that Sa(x) is zero
whenever x is an integral multiple of π ; that is,
                       Sa(nπ) = 0         n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
When x is zero, the function is indeterminate, but it is easy to show that its
value is unity:
                                   Sa(0) = 1
The magnitude of Sa(x) therefore decreases from unity at x = 0 to zero at
x = π . As x increases from π to 2π , |Sa(x)| increases from zero to a max-
imum less than unity, and then decreases to zero once again. As x continues
to increase, the successive maxima continually become smaller because the
numerator of Sa(x) cannot exceed unity and the denominator is continually
increasing. Also, Sa(x) shows even symmetry.
    Now let us construct the line spectrum. We first consider |cn |, writing
Eq. [36] in terms of the fundamental cyclic frequency f0:
                                                        
                                  V0 τ  sin(nπf 0 τ ) 
                          |cn | =                                       [38]
                                   T  nπf 0 τ 
The amplitude of any cn is obtained from Eq. [38] by using the known
values τ and T = 1/ f 0 and selecting the desired value of n, n = 0, ±1,
±2, . . . . Instead of evaluating Eq. [38] at these discrete frequencies, let us
sketch the envelope of |cn | by considering the frequency n f 0 to be a contin-
uous variable. That is, f, which is n f 0 , can actually take on only the discrete
values of the harmonic frequencies 0, ± f 0 , ±2 f 0 , ±3 f 0 , and so forth,
but we may think of n for the moment as a continuous variable. When f is
zero, |cn | is evidently V0 τ/T , and when f has increased to 1/τ , |cn | is
zero. The resultant envelope is first sketched as in Fig. 18.12a. The
line spectrum is then obtained by simply erecting a vertical line at each
harmonic frequency, as shown in the sketch. The amplitudes shown are
those of the cn . The particular case sketched applies to the case where
τ/T = 1/(1.5π) = 0.212. In this example, it happens that there is no har-
monic exactly at that frequency at which the envelope amplitude is zero;
another choice of τ or T could produce such an occurrence, however.
     In Fig. 18.12b, the amplitude of the sinusoidal component is plotted as a
function of frequency. Note again that a0 = c0 and an2 + bn2 = |cn | + |c−n |.
     There are several observations and conclusions which we may make
about the line spectrum of a periodic sequence of rectangular pulses, as
given in Fig. 18.12b. With respect to the envelope of the discrete spectrum,
it is evident that the “width” of the envelope depends upon τ , and not upon
T. As a matter of fact, the shape of the envelope is not a function of T. It
follows that the bandwidth of a filter which is designed to pass the periodic
pulses is a function of the pulse width τ , but not of the pulse period T; an

inspection of Fig. 18.12b indicates that the required bandwidth is about
1/τ Hz. If the pulse period T is increased (or the pulse repetition frequency
f0 is decreased), the bandwidth 1/τ does not change, but the number of
spectral lines between zero frequency and 1/τ Hz increases, albeit discon-
tinuously; the amplitude of each line is inversely proportional to T. Finally,
a shift in the time origin does not change the line spectrum; that is, |cn | is
not a function of t0. The relative phases of the frequency components do
change with the choice of t0.

18.5       DEFINITION OF THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
       •
Now that we are familiar with the basic concepts of the Fourier series
representation of periodic functions, let us proceed to define the Fourier
transform by first recalling the spectrum of the periodic train of rectangular
pulses we obtained in Sec. 18.4. That was a discrete line spectrum, which is
the type that we must always obtain for periodic functions of time. The
spectrum was discrete in the sense that it was not a smooth or continuous
function of frequency; instead, it had nonzero values only at specific
frequencies.
    There are many important forcing functions, however, that are not peri-
odic functions of time, such as a single rectangular pulse, a step function, a
ramp function, or the somewhat strange type of function called the impulse
function defined in Chap. 14. Frequency spectra may be obtained for such
nonperiodic functions, but they will be continuous spectra in which some
energy, in general, may be found in any nonzero frequency interval, no
matter how small.
    We will develop this concept by beginning with a periodic function and
then letting the period become infinite. Our experience with periodic
rectangular pulses should indicate that the envelope will decrease in ampli-
tude without otherwise changing shape, and that more and more frequency
components will be found in any given frequency interval. In the limit, we
should expect an envelope of vanishingly small amplitude, filled with an
infinite number of frequency components separated by vanishingly small
frequency intervals. The number of frequency components between 0 and
100 Hz, for example, becomes infinite, but the amplitude of each one
approaches zero. At first thought, a spectrum of zero amplitude is a puzzling
concept. We know that the line spectrum of a periodic forcing function
shows the amplitude of each frequency component. But what does the zero-
amplitude continuous spectrum of a nonperiodic forcing function signify?
That question will be answered in the following section; now we proceed to
carry out the limiting procedure just suggested.
758   CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS


          We begin with the exponential form of the Fourier series:
                                         ∞
                                f (t) =      cn e jnω0 t                      [39]
                                               n=−∞
      where
                                             T /2
                                       1
                                cn =                 f (t)e−jnω0 t dt         [40]
                                       T     −T /2
      and
                                                     2π
                                             ω0 =                             [41]
                                                      T
          We now let
                                             T →∞
      and thus, from Eq. [41], ω0 must become vanishingly small. We represent
      this limit by a differential:
                                             ω0 → dω
      Thus
                                       1   ω0   dω
                                         =    →                               [42]
                                       T   2π   2π
      Finally, the frequency of any “harmonic” nω0 must now correspond to the
      general frequency variable which describes the continuous spectrum. In
      other words, n must tend to infinity as ω0 approaches zero, so that the prod-
      uct is finite:
                                             nω0 → ω                          [43]
          When these four limiting operations are applied to Eq. [40], we find that
      cn must approach zero, as we had previously presumed. If we multiply each
      side of Eq. [40] by the period T and then undertake the limiting process, a
      nontrivial result is obtained:
                                         ∞
                                 cn T →     f (t)e− jωt dt
                                              −∞

      The right-hand side of this expression is a function of ω (and not of t), and
      we represent it by F( jω):
                                         ∞
                              F( jω) =        f (t)e− jωt dt                   [44]
                                               −∞

         Now let us apply the limiting process to Eq. [39]. We begin by multi-
      plying and dividing the summation by T,

Equations [44] and [45] are collectively called the Fourier transform pair.               The reader may have already noticed a few similarities
The function F( jω) is the Fourier transform of f (t), and f (t) is the inverse           between the Fourier transform and the Laplace trans-

The exponential terms in these two equations carry opposite signs for the
exponents. To keep them straight, it may help to note that the positive sign
is associated with the expression for f (t), as it is with the complex Fourier
series, Eq. [39].
    It is appropriate to raise one question at this time. For the Fourier trans-
form relationships of Eq. [46], can we obtain the Fourier transform of any
arbitrarily chosen f (t)? It turns out that the answer is affirmative for almost
any voltage or current that we can actually produce. A sufficient condition
for the existence of F( jω) is that
                               ∞
                                   | f (t)| dt < ∞
                              −∞

This condition is not necessary, however, because some functions that do
not meet it still have a Fourier transform; the step function is one such ex-
ample. Furthermore, we will see later that f (t) does not even need to be
nonperiodic in order to have a Fourier transform; the Fourier series repre-
sentation for a periodic time function is just a special case of the more gen-
eral Fourier transform representation.
    As we indicated earlier, the Fourier transform-pair relationship is
unique. For a given f (t) there is one specific F( jω); and for a given F( jω)
there is one specific f (t).

       The Fourier transform of f (t) is found from Eq. [46a]:
                                         t0 +τ
                            F( jω) =            V0 e− jωt dt

       and this may be easily integrated and simplified:

 dimensionally “volts per unit frequency,” a concept that was introduced
 in Sec. 15.1.

18.6       SOME PROPERTIES OF THE FOURIER
       •
           TRANSFORM
Our object in this section is to establish several of the mathematical proper-
ties of the Fourier transform and, even more important, to understand its
physical significance. We begin by using Euler’s identity to replace e− jωt in
Eq. [46a]:
                       ∞                        ∞
            F( jω) =        f (t) cos ωt dt − j       f (t) sin ωt dt     [47]
                          −∞                          −∞

Since f (t), cos ωt, and sin ωt are all real functions of time, both the
integrals in Eq. [47] are real functions of ω. Thus, by letting
                     F( jω) = A(ω) + jB(ω) = |F( jω)|e jφ(ω)                     [48]
we have
                                         ∞
                               A(ω) =         f (t) cos ωt dt                    [49]

                               B(ω) = −          f (t) sin ωt dt                 [50]
                                            −∞


                          |F( jω)| =      A2 (ω) + B 2 (ω)                       [51]
and
                                               B(ω)
                               φ(ω) = tan−1                                      [52]
                                               A(ω)
Replacing ω by −ω shows that A(ω) and |F( jω)| are both even functions
of ω, while B(ω) and φ(ω) are both odd functions of ω.
    Now, if f (t) is an even function of t, then the integrand of Eq. [50] is an
odd function of t, and the symmetrical limits force B(ω) to be zero; thus, if
f (t) is even, its Fourier transform F( jω) is a real, even function of ω,
and the phase function φ(ω) is zero or π for all ω. However, if f (t) is an

                                                          odd function of t, then A(ω) = 0 and F( jω) is both odd and a pure imagi-
                                                          nary function of ω; φ(ω) is ±π/2. In general, however, F( jω) is a complex
                                                          function of ω.
                                                             Finally, we note that the replacement of ω by −ω in Eq. [47] forms the
                                                          conjugate of F( jω). Thus,
                                                                               F(− jω) = A(ω) − jB(ω) = F∗ ( jω)
                                                          and we have
                                                                F( jω)F(− jω) = F( jω)F∗ ( jω) = A2 (ω) + B 2 (ω) = |F( jω)|2

                                                          With these basic mathematical properties of the Fourier transform in mind,
                                                          we are now ready to consider its physical significance. Let us suppose that
                                                          f (t) is either the voltage across or the current through a 1  resistor, so that
                                                          f 2 (t) is the instantaneous power delivered to the 1  resistor by f (t). Inte-

                                                                                                 ∞
                                                                                        W1 =         f 2 (t) dt                      [53]
                                                                                                −∞

                                                          Now let us resort to a little trickery. Thinking of the integrand in Eq. [53] as
                                                          f (t) times itself, we replace one of those functions with Eq. [46b]:

Figure 18.14 illustrates a typical plot of |Fv ( jω)|2 as a function of both ω and
f. If we divide the frequency scale up into vanishingly small increments d f ,
Eq. [55] shows us that the area of a differential slice under the |Fv ( jω)|2 curve,
having a width d f , is |Fv ( jω)|2 d f . This area is shown shaded. The sum of all
such areas, as f ranges from minus to plus infinity, is the total 1  energy con-
tained in v(t). Thus, |Fv ( jω)|2 is the (1 ) energy density or energy per unit
bandwidth (J/Hz) of v(t), and this energy density is always a real, even, non-
negative function of ω. By integrating |Fv ( jω)|2 over an appropriate fre-
quency interval, we are able to calculate that portion of the total energy lying
within the chosen interval. Note that the energy density is not a function of the
phase of Fv ( jω), and thus there are an infinite number of time functions and
Fourier transforms that possess identical energy-density functions.


                                                                                                     EXAMPLE 18.6

          In general, we see that an ideal bandpass filter enables us to remove
      energy from prescribed frequency ranges while still retaining the energy
      contained in other frequency ranges. The Fourier transform helps us to
      describe the filtering action quantitatively without actually evaluating vo (t),
      although we will see later that the Fourier transform can also be used to
      obtain the expression for vo (t) if we wish to do so.

      18.7      FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIRS FOR SOME
             • SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS
      The Unit-Impulse Function
      We now seek the Fourier transform of the unit impulse δ(t − t0 ), a function
      we introduced in Sec. 14.4. That is, we are interested in the spectral proper-
      ties or frequency-domain description of this singularity function. If we use
      the notation F{ } to symbolize “Fourier transform of {},” then
                                           ∞
                         F {δ(t − t0 )} =     e− jωt δ(t − t0 ) dt
                                               −∞

      From our earlier discussion of this type of integral, we have
                       F {δ(t − t0 )} = e− jωt0 = cos ωt0 − j sin ωt0
                 SECTION 18.7 FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIRS FOR SOME SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS   765

This complex function of ω leads to the 1  energy-density function,
                 |F {δ(t − t0 )}|2 = cos2 ωt0 + sin2 ωt0 = 1
This remarkable result says that the (1 ) energy per unit bandwidth is unity
at all frequencies, and that the total energy in the unit impulse is infinitely
large. No wonder, then, that we must conclude that the unit impulse is
“impractical” in the sense that it cannot be generated in the laboratory. More-
over, even if one were available to us, it must appear distorted after being
subjected to the finite bandwidth of any practical laboratory instrument.
    Since there is a unique one-to-one correspondence between a time func-
tion and its Fourier transform, we can say that the inverse Fourier transform
of e− jωt0 is δ(t − t0 ). Utilizing the symbol F −1 { } for the inverse transform,
we have
                           F −1 {e− jωt0 } = δ(t − t0 )
Thus, we now know that
                      ∞
                   1
                         e jωte− jωt0 dω = δ(t − t0 )
                 2π −∞

even though we would fail in an attempt at the direct evaluation of this
improper integral. Symbolically, we may write
                              δ(t − t0 ) ⇔ e− jωt0                             [56]
where ⇔ indicates that the two functions constitute a Fourier transform pair.
   Continuing with our consideration of the unit-impulse function, let us
consider a Fourier transform in that form,
                             F( jω) = δ(ω − ω0 )
which is a unit impulse in the frequency domain located at ω = ω0 . Then
f (t) must be
                                   ∞
                                1                            1 jω0 t
       f (t) = F −1 {F( jω)} =        e jωt δ(ω − ω0 ) dω =    e
                               2π −∞                        2π

where we have used the sifting property of the unit impulse. Thus we may
now write
                             1 jω0 t
                               e     ⇔ δ(ω − ω0 )
                            2π
or
                            e jω0 t ⇔ 2πδ(ω − ω0 )                             [57]

Also, by a simple sign change we obtain
                            e− jω0 t ⇔ 2πδ(ω + ω0 )                            [58]
Clearly, the time function is complex in both expressions [57] and [58], and
does not exist in the real world of the laboratory.
   However, we know that
                         cos ω0 t = 12 e jω0 t + 12 e− jω0 t
766   CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS


      and it is easily seen from the definition of the Fourier transform that
                         F { f 1 (t)} + F { f 2 (t)} = F { f 1 (t) + f 2 (t)}   [59]
      Therefore,

                                        = πδ(ω − ω0 ) + πδ(ω + ω0 )
      which indicates that the frequency-domain description of cos ω0 t shows a
      pair of impulses, located at ω = ±ω0 . This should not be a great surprise,
      for in our first discussion of complex frequency in Chap. 14, we noted that
      a sinusoidal function of time was always represented by a pair of imaginary
      frequencies located at s = ± jω0 . We have, therefore,
                           cos ω0 t ⇔ π[δ(ω + ω0 ) + δ(ω − ω0 )]                [60]

      The Constant Forcing Function
      To find the Fourier transform of a constant function of time, f (t) = K, our
      first inclination might be to substitute this constant in the defining equation
      for the Fourier transform and evaluate the resulting integral. If we did, we
      would find ourselves with an indeterminate expression on our hands.
      Fortunately, however, we have already solved this problem, for from
      expression [58],
                                    e− jω0 t ⇔ 2πδ(ω + ω0 )
      We see that if we simply let ω0 = 0, then the resulting transform pair is
                                            1 ⇔ 2πδ(ω)                          [61]
      from which it follows that
                                         K ⇔ 2πKδ(ω)                            [62]
      and our problem is solved. The frequency spectrum of a constant function
      of time consists only of a component at ω = 0, which we knew all along.

      The Signum Function
      As another example, let us obtain the Fourier transform of a singularity
      function known as the signum function, sgn(t), defined by
                                        
                                          −1 t < 0
                               sgn(t) =                                  [63]
                                           1 t >0
      or
                                    sgn(t) = u(t) − u(−t)
      Again, if we should try to substitute this time function in the defining equa-
      tion for the Fourier transform, we would face an indeterminate expression
      upon substitution of the limits of integration. This same problem will arise
      every time we attempt to obtain the Fourier transform of a time function that
      does not approach zero as |t| approaches infinity. Fortunately, we can avoid
      this situation by using the Laplace transform, as it contains a built-in con-
      vergence factor that cures many of the inconvenient ills associated with the
      evaluation of certain Fourier transforms.
                 SECTION 18.7 FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIRS FOR SOME SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS                767

    Along those lines, the signum function under consideration can be writ-
ten as
                      sgn(t) = lim [e−atu(t) − eatu(−t)]
                                 a→0
Notice that the expression within the brackets does approach zero as |t| gets
very large. Using the definition of the Fourier transform, we obtain
                               ∞                   0
                                    − jωt −at
         F {sgn(t)} = lim         e      e dt −        e− jωt eat dt
                         a→0     0                      −∞

                                − j2ω         2
                      = lim              =
                         a→0 ω2 + a 2        jω
The real component is zero, since sgn(t) is an odd function of t. Thus,
                                           2
                              sgn(t) ⇔                                  [64]
                                          jω

The Unit-Step Function
As a final example in this section, let us look at the familiar unit-step func-
tion, u(t). Making use of our work on the signum function in the preceding
paragraphs, we represent the unit step by
                               u(t) = 12 + 12 sgn(t)
and obtain the Fourier transform pair
                                                   1
                            u(t) ⇔ πδ(ω) +                                        [65]
                                                  jω
Table 18.2 presents the conclusions drawn from the examples discussed in
this section, along with a few others that have not been detailed here.


                                                                                         EXAMPLE 18.7
 Use Table 18.2 to find the Fourier transform of the time function
 3e−t cos 4t u(t).
 From the next to the last entry in the table, we have
                                                 α + jω
                    e−αt cos ωd t u(t) ⇔
                                             (α + jω)2 + ωd2
 We therefore identify α as 1 and ωd as 4, and have
                                            1 + jω
                          F( jω) = 3

18.8     THE FOURIER TRANSFORM OF A GENERAL
       • PERIODIC TIME FUNCTION
In Sec. 18.5 we remarked that we would be able to show that periodic time
functions, as well as nonperiodic functions, possess Fourier transforms. Let
us now establish this fact on a rigorous basis. Consider a periodic time func-
tion f (t) with period T and Fourier series expansion, as outlined by
Eqs. [39], [40], and [41], repeated here for convenience:
                                       

Bearing in mind that the Fourier transform of a sum is just the sum of the
transforms of the terms in the sum, and that cn is not a function of time, we
can write

After obtaining the transform of e             from expression [57], we have
                                      
                                      ∞
                       f (t) ⇔ 2π              cn δ(ω − nω0 )                  [66]
                                     n=−∞

This shows that f (t) has a discrete spectrum consisting of impulses located
at points on the ω axis given by ω = nω0, n = . . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, . . . . The
strength of each impulse is 2π times the value of the corresponding Fourier
coefficient appearing in the complex form of the Fourier series expansion
for f (t).
    As a check on our work, let us see whether the inverse Fourier transform
of the right side of expression [66] is once again f (t). This inverse trans-
form can be written as
                          ∞        "                       #
                      1                  ∞
                                                                  ?
       −1                       jωt
    F {F( jω)} =              e      2π      cn δ(ω − nω0 ) dω = f (t)
                     2π −∞              n=−∞

Since the exponential term does not contain the index of summation n, we
can interchange the order of the integration and summation operations:
                          ∞  ∞
                                                             ?
          F −1 {F( jω)} =            cn e jωt δ(ω − nω0 ) dω = f (t)
                          n=−∞ −∞

Because it is not a function of the variable of integration, cn can be treated
as a constant. Then, using the sifting property of the impulse, we obtain
                                        
                                        ∞

      which is exactly the same as Eq. [39], the complex Fourier series expan-
      sion for f (t). The question marks in the preceding equations can now be
      removed, and the existence of the Fourier transform for a periodic time
      function is established. This should come as no great surprise, however.
      In the last section we evaluated the Fourier transform of a cosine func-
      tion, which is certainly periodic, although we made no direct reference
      to its periodicity. However, we did use a backhanded approach in getting
      the transform. But now we have a mathematical tool by which the
      transform can be obtained more directly. To demonstrate this procedure,
      consider f (t) = cos ω0 t once more. First we evaluate the Fourier
      coefficients cn :
                                T /2                             1
                           1                                           n = ±1
                   cn =                 cos ω0 t e− jnω0 t dt =    2
                           T    −T /2                              0   otherwise

      Then

                                                   
                                                   ∞
                               F { f (t)} = 2π           cn δ(ω − nω0 )
                                                  n=−∞

      This expression has values that are nonzero only when n = ±1, and it fol-
      lows, therefore, that the entire summation reduces to
                          F {cos ω0 t} = π[δ(ω − ω0 ) + δ(ω + ω0 )]
      which is precisely the expression that we obtained before. What a relief!

      18.9 THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND RESPONSE
          • IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
      In Sec. 15.5, the problem of determining the output of a physical system
      in terms of the input and the impulse response was solved by using the
      convolution integral and initially working in the time domain. The input,
      the output, and the impulse response are all time functions. Subsequently,
      we found that it was often more convenient to perform such operations in
      the frequency domain, as the Laplace transform of the convolution of two
      functions is simply the product of each function in the frequency domain.
      Along the same lines, we find the same is true when working with Fourier
      transforms.
          To do this we examine the Fourier transform of the system output. As-
      suming arbitrarily that the input and output are voltages, we apply the basic
             SECTION 18.9 THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND RESPONSE IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN   771


definition of the Fourier transform and express the output by the convolution
integral:
                                 ∞           ∞
                                       − jωt
        F {v0 (t)} = F0 ( jω) =      e           vi (t − z)h(z) dz dt
                                     −∞                −∞

where we again assume no initial energy storage. At first glance this
expression may seem rather formidable, but it can be reduced to a result that
is surprisingly simple. We may move the exponential term inside the inner
integral because it does not contain the variable of integration z. Next we
reverse the order of integration, obtaining
                          ∞  ∞
              F0 ( jω) =             e− jωt vi (t − z)h(z) dt dz
                          −∞         −∞

Since it is not a function of t, we can extract h(z) from the inner integral
and simplify the integration with respect to t by a change of variable,
t − z = x:
                         ∞         ∞
             F0 ( jω) =     h(z)       e− jω(x+z) vi (x) dx dz
                         −∞                −∞
                         ∞                       ∞
                                  − jωz
                    =         e           h(z)         e− jωx vi (x) dx dz
                         −∞                       −∞

But now the sun is starting to break through, for the inner integral is merely
the Fourier transform of vi (t). Furthermore, it contains no z terms and can
be treated as a constant in any integration involving z. Thus, we can move
this transform, Fi ( jω), completely outside all the integral signs:
                                          ∞
                     F0 ( jω) = Fi ( jω)     e− jωz h(z) dz
                                                 −∞

Finally, the remaining integral exhibits our old friend once more, another
Fourier transform! This one is the Fourier transform of the impulse re-
sponse, which we will designate by the notation H( jω). Therefore, all our
work has boiled down to the simple result:

                F0 ( jω) = Fi ( jω)H( jω) = Fi ( jω)F {h(t)}

This is another important result: it defines the system function H( jω) as the
ratio of the Fourier transform of the response function to the Fourier trans-
form of the forcing function. Moreover, the system function and the impulse
response constitute a Fourier transform pair:

                                   h(t) ⇔ H( jω)                             [67]

   The development in the preceding paragraph also serves to prove the
general statement that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two time
functions is the product of their Fourier transforms,

                     F { f (t) ∗ g(t)} = F f ( jω)Fg ( jω)                   [68]

  To recapitulate, if we know the Fourier transforms of the
                                                                The foregoing comments might make us wonder once again why we would

  Fourier transform of the response function can be ob-
                                                                that we seldom get something for nothing. A poet once said, “Our sincerest

                                                                ficulty in obtaining the inverse Fourier transform of a response function, for

                                                                Consequently there is no clear-cut advantage between working in the time
  plication in the frequency domain.

                                                                We first obtain the corresponding Fourier transforms. The forcing function
                                                                is the difference between two unit-step functions. These two functions are
                                                                identical, except that one is initiated 1 s after the other. We will evaluate the

select a technique for obtaining a partial-fraction expansion that has one big
advantage—it always works, although faster methods are usually available
for most situations. We assign an unknown quantity in the numerator of each
fraction, here two in number,

                        jω(1 + jω)   jω 1 + jω

and then substitute a corresponding number of simple values for jω. Here
we let jω = 1:
                                             B
                                  1= A+

and then let jω = −2:

                                           2

This leads to A = 2 and B = −2. Thus,

so that

                               = 2(1 − e−t )u(t)
It follows that vo2 (t), the component of vo (t) produced by u(t − 1), is
                      vo2 (t) = 2(1 − e−(t−1) )u(t − 1)
Therefore,
              vo (t) = vo1 (t) − vo2 (t)
                    = 2(1 − e−t )u(t) − 2(1 − e−t+1 )u(t − 1)

  COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
                             The material presented in this chapter forms the foundation for many
                             advanced fields of study, including signal processing, communica-
                             tions, and controls. We are only able to introduce some of the more
                             fundamental concepts within the context of an introductory circuits
                             text, but even at this point some of the power of Fourier-based analy-
                             sis can be brought to bear. As a first example, consider the op amp
                             circuit of Fig. 18.15, constructed in PSpice using a μA741 opera-
                             tional amplifier.

                                The circuit has a voltage gain of −10, and so we would expect a
                             sinusoidal output of 10 V amplitude. This is indeed what we obtain
                             from a transient analysis of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 18.16.

    PSpice allows us to determine the frequency spectrum of the output
voltage through what is known as a fast Fourier transform (FFT), a
discrete-time approximation to the exact Fourier transform of the sig-
nal. From within Probe, we select Fourier under the Trace menu; the
result is the plot shown in Fig. 18.17. As expected, the line spectrum for
the output voltage of this amplifier circuit consists of a single feature at
a frequency of 100 Hz.




■ FIGURE 18.17 Discrete approximation to the Fourier transform of Fig. 18.16.

    As the input voltage magnitude is increased, the output of the ampli-
fier approaches the saturation condition determined by the positive and
negative dc supply voltages (±15 V in this example). This behavior is
evident in the simulation result of Fig. 18.18, which corresponds to an
input voltage magnitude of 1.8 V. A key feature of interest is that the
output voltage waveform is no longer a pure sinusoid. As a result, we
expect nonzero values at harmonic frequencies to appear in the

  frequency spectrum of the function, as is the case in Fig. 18.19. The ef-
  fect of reaching saturation in the amplifier circuit is a distortion of the
  signal; if connected to a speaker, we do not hear a “clean” 100 Hz
  waveform. Instead, we now hear a superposition of waveforms which
  include not only the 100 Hz fundamental frequency, but significant har-
  monic components at 300 and 500 Hz as well. Further distortion of the
  waveform would increase the amount of energy in harmonic frequen-
  cies, so that contributions from higher-frequency harmonics would
  become more significant. This is evident in the simulation results of
  Fig. 18.20a and b, which show the output voltage in the time and
  frequency domains, respectively.



18.10          THE PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
           • SYSTEM FUNCTION
In this section we will try to connect several aspects of the Fourier trans-
form with work we completed in earlier chapters.
    Given a general linear two-port network N without any initial energy
storage, we assume sinusoidal forcing and response functions, arbitrarily
taken to be voltages, as shown in Fig. 18.21. We let the input voltage be
simply A cos(ωx t + θ), and the output can be described in general terms as
vo (t) = B cos(ωx t + φ), where the amplitude B and phase angle φ are
functions of ωx . In phasor form, we can write the forcing and response func-
tions as Vi = Ae jθ and Vo = Be jφ . The ratio of the phasor response to the
phasor forcing function is a complex number that is a function of ωx :
                                 Vo           B
                                    = G(ωx ) = e j (φ−θ)
                                 Vi           A
where B/A is the amplitude of G and φ − θ is its phase angle. This transfer
function G(ωx ) could be obtained in the laboratory by varying ωx over a
large range of values and measuring the amplitude B/A and phase φ − θ
for each value of ωx . If we then plotted each of these parameters as a func-
tion of frequency, the resultant pair of curves would completely describe the
transfer function.

  transfer function H( jωx ) = ( B/A )e j (φ−θ) , where B and φ are
  functions of ωx .


    Now let us hold these comments in the backs of our minds for a moment
as we consider a slightly different aspect of the same analysis problem.
    For the circuit with sinusoidal input and output shown in Fig. 18.21,
what is the system function H( jω)? To answer this question, we begin with
the definition of H( jω) as the ratio of the Fourier transforms of the output
and the input. Both of these time functions involve the functional form

      cos(ωx t + β), whose Fourier transform we have not evaluated as yet,
      although we can handle cos ωx t . The transform we need is

                   F {cos(ωx t + β)} =        e− jωt cos(ωx t + β) dt
                                                 −∞

      If we make the substitution ωx t + β = ωxτ , then
                                     ∞
               F {cos(ωx t + β)} =        e− jωτ + jωβ/ωx cos ωxτ dτ
                                            −∞
                                      = e jωβ/ωx F {cos ωx t}
                                      = πe jωβ/ωx [δ(ω − ωx ) + δ(ω + ωx )]

      This is a new Fourier transform pair,
                   cos(ωx t + β) ⇔ πe jωβ/ωx [δ(ω − ωx ) + δ(ω + ωx )]        [69]
      which we can now use to evaluate the desired system function,
                                  F {B cos(ωx t + φ)}
                      H( jω) =
                                  F {A cos(ωx t + θ)}
                             πBe jωφ/ωx [δ(ω − ωx ) + δ(ω + ωx )]
                              =
                             πAe jωθ/ωx [δ(ω − ωx ) + δ(ω + ωx )]
                             B
                          = e jω(φ−θ)/ωx
                             A
      Now we recall the expression for G(ωx ),
                                                  B j (φ−θ)
                                      G(ωx ) =      e
                                                  A
      where B and φ were evaluated at ω = ωx , and we see that evaluating
      H( jω) at ω = ωx gives
                                                       B j (φ−θ)
                                H(ωx ) = G(ωx ) =        e
                                                       A
      Since there is nothing special about the x subscript, we conclude that the
      system function and the transfer function are identical:
                                        H( jω) = G(ω)                         [70]
      The fact that one argument is ω while the other is indicated by jω is imma-
      terial and arbitrary; the j merely makes possible a more direct comparison
      between the Fourier and Laplace transforms.
          Equation [70] represents a direct connection between Fourier transform
      techniques and sinusoidal steady-state analysis. Our previous work on
      steady-state sinusoidal analysis using phasors was but a special case of the
      more general techniques of Fourier transform analysis. It was ‘‘special’’ in
      the sense that the inputs and outputs were sinusoids, whereas the use of
      Fourier transforms and system functions enables us to handle nonsinusoidal
      forcing functions and responses.
          Thus, to find the system function H( jω) for a network, all we need to do
      is to determine the corresponding sinusoidal transfer function as a function
      of ω (or jω).

                                                      and the sinusoidal steady-state transfer function G(ω), we may now consider
                                                      the system function as the ratio of the output phasor to the input phasor. Sup-
                                                      pose that we hold the input-phasor amplitude at unity and the phase angle at
                                                      zero. Then the output phasor is H( jω). Under these conditions, if we record
                                                      the output amplitude and phase as functions of ω, for all ω, we have recorded
                                                      the system function H( jω) as a function of ω, for all ω. We thus have exam-

impulse response h(t). Is the information we examine really any different
from what we just obtained? The Fourier transform of the unit impulse is a
constant equal to unity, indicating that all frequency components are present,
all with the same magnitude, and all with zero phase. Our system response is
the sum of the responses to all these components. The result might be viewed
at the output on a cathode-ray oscilloscope. It is evident that the system func-
tion and the impulse-response function contain equivalent information re-
garding the response of the system.
    We therefore have two different methods of describing the response of a
system to a general forcing function; one is a time-domain description, and
the other a frequency-domain description. Working in the time domain, we
782   CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS


      convolve the forcing function with the impulse response of the system to
      obtain the response function. As we saw when we first considered convolu-
      tion, this procedure may be interpreted by thinking of the input as a contin-
      uum of impulses of different strengths and times of application; the output
      which results is a continuum of impulse responses.
          In the frequency domain, however, we determine the response by
      multiplying the Fourier transform of the forcing function by the system
      function. In this case we interpret the transform of the forcing function as a
      frequency spectrum, or a continuum of sinusoids. Multiplying this by the
      system function, we obtain the response function, also as a continuum of
      sinusoids.



      SUMMARY AND REVIEW
      Whether we choose to think of the output as a continuum of impulse
      responses or as a continuum of sinusoidal responses, the linearity of the net-
      work and the superposition principle enable us to determine the total output
      as a time function by summing over all frequencies (the inverse Fourier
      transform), or as a frequency function by summing over all time (the
      Fourier transform).
          Unfortunately, both of these techniques have some difficulties or limi-
      tations associated with their use. In using convolution, the integral itself
      can often be rather difficult to evaluate when complicated forcing func-
      tions or impulse response functions are present. Furthermore, from the
      experimental point of view, we cannot really measure the impulse re-
      sponse of a system because we cannot actually generate an impulse. Even
      if we approximated the impulse by a narrow high-amplitude pulse, we
      would probably drive our system into saturation and out of its linear oper-
      ating range.
          With regard to the frequency domain, we encounter one absolute limita-
      tion in that we may easily hypothesize forcing functions that we would like
      to apply theoretically that do not possess Fourier transforms. Moreover, if
      we wish to find the time-domain description of the response function, we
      must evaluate an inverse Fourier transform, and some of these inversions
      can be extremely difficult.
          Finally, neither of these techniques offers a very convenient method
      of handling initial conditions. For this, the Laplace transform is clearly
      superior.
          The greatest benefits derived from the use of the Fourier transform arise
      through the abundance of useful information it provides about the spectral
      properties of a signal, particularly the energy or power per unit bandwidth.
      Some of this information is also easily obtained through the Laplace trans-
      form; we must leave a detailed discussion of the relative merits of each to
      more advanced signals and systems courses.
          So, why has this all been withheld until now? The best answer is proba-
      bly that these powerful techniques can overcomplicate the solution of
      simple problems and tend to obscure the physical interpretation of the per-
      formance of the simpler networks. For example, if we are interested only in
      the forced response, then there is little point in using the Laplace transform
                                                                            EXERCISES   783

and obtaining both the forced and natural response after laboring through a
difficult inverse transform operation.
    Well, we could go on, but all good things must come to an end. Best of
luck to you in your future studies.
❑   The harmonic frequencies of a sinusoid having the fundamental
    frequency ω0 are nω0 , where n is an integer. (Examples 18.1, 18.2)
❑   The Fourier theorem states that provided a function f (t) satisfies
    certain
          key properties, it may be represented by the infiniteseries

❑   A function f (t) possesses even symmetry if f (t) = f (−t).
❑   A function f (t) possesses odd symmetry if f (t) = − f (−t).
❑   A function f (t) possesses half-wave symmetry if f (t) = − f (t − 12 T ).
❑   The Fourier series of an even function is composed of only a constant
    and cosine functions.
❑   The Fourier series of an odd function is composed of only sine functions.
❑   The Fourier series of any function possessing half-wave symmetry
    contains only odd harmonics.

    or exponential  form, where f (t) = ∞

    cn = (1/T ) −T /2 f (t)e          dt . (Examples 18.3, 18.4)
❑   The Fourier transform allows us to represent time-varying functions
    in the frequency domain, in a manner similar to that of the Laplace

❑   Fourier transform analysis can be implemented to analyze circuits
    containing resistors, inductors, and/or capacitors in a manner similar to
    what is done using Laplace transforms. (Example 18.8)

AN INTRODUCTION TO
NETWORK TOPOLOGY

After working many circuits problems, it slowly becomes evident that many
of the circuits we see have quite a bit in common, at least in terms of the
arrangement of components. From this realization, it is possible to create a
more abstract view of circuits which we call network topology, a subject we
introduce in this appendix.


A1.1       TREES AND GENERAL NODAL ANALYSIS
       •
We now plan to generalize the method of nodal analysis that we have come
to know and love. Since nodal analysis is applicable to any network, we
cannot promise that we will be able to solve a wider class of circuit prob-
lems. We can, however, look forward to being able to select a general nodal
analysis method for any particular problem that may result in fewer equa-
tions and less work.
    We must first extend our list of definitions relating to network topology.
We begin by defining topology itself as a branch of geometry which is con-
cerned with those properties of a geometrical figure which are unchanged                                 – +
when the figure is twisted, bent, folded, stretched, squeezed, or tied in knots,
with the provision that no parts of the figure are to be cut apart or to be
joined together. A sphere and a tetrahedron are topologically identical, as
are a square and a circle. In terms of electric circuits, then, we are not now
concerned with the particular types of elements appearing in the circuit, but                +
only with the way in which branches and nodes are arranged. As a matter of                   –

fact, we usually suppress the nature of the elements and simplify the draw-
ing of the circuit by showing the elements as lines. The resultant drawing is
called a linear graph, or simply a graph. A circuit and its graph are shown in                             (a)
Fig. A1.1. Note that all nodes are identified by heavy dots in the graph.
    Since the topological properties of the circuit or its graph are unchanged
when it is distorted, the three graphs shown in Fig. A1.2 are all topologi-
cally identical with the circuit and graph of Fig. A1.1.
    Topological terms that we already know and have been using correctly
are
   Node: A point at which two or more elements have a common
   connection.
   Path: A set of elements that may be traversed in order without passing
   through the same node twice.                                                                             (b)
   Branch: A single path, containing one simple element, which connects            ■ FIGURE A1.1 (a) A given circuit. (b) The linear

                                                                 Nonplanar circuit: Any circuit which is not planar.
                                                             The graphs of Fig. A1.2 each contain 12 branches and 7 nodes.
                                                                 Three new properties of a linear graph must now be defined—a tree, a
                                                             cotree, and a link. We define a tree as any set of branches which does not
                                                             contain any loops and yet connects every node to every other node, not nec-
                                                             essarily directly. There are usually a number of different trees which may
                                                             be drawn for a network, and the number increases rapidly as the complex-

                                                             eight possible trees, four of which are shown by heavy lines in Fig. A1.3b,

                                                             possible tree, and Fig. A1.4c and d show sets of branches which are not
                                                             trees because neither set satisfies the definition.
                                                                 After a tree has been specified, those branches that are not part of the

                                                             of the link is very simple, for a link is any branch belonging to the cotree. It
                                                             is evident that any particular branch may or may not be a link, depending on
                                                             the particular tree which is selected.
               (c)                         (d)                   The number of links in a graph may easily be related to the number of
 ■ FIGURE A1.4 (a) A linear graph. (b) A possible            branches and nodes. If the graph has N nodes, then exactly (N − 1)
   tree for this graph. (c , d ) These sets of branches do   branches are required to construct a tree because the first branch chosen
   not satisfy the definition of a tree.                     connects two nodes and each additional branch includes one more node.
                                  APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY    793

Thus, given B branches, the number of links L must be
                               L = B − (N − 1)
or
                                L = B− N +1                                   [1]
There are L branches in the cotree and (N − 1) branches in the tree.
    In any of the graphs shown in Fig. A1.3, we note that 3 = 5 − 3 + 1, and
in the graph of Fig. A1.4b, 6 = 10 − 5 + 1. A network may be in several
disconnected parts, and Eq. [1] may be made more general by replacing +1
with +S, where S is the number of separate parts. However, it is also possi-
ble to connect two separate parts by a single conductor, thus causing two
nodes to form one node; no current can flow through this single conductor.
This process may be used to join any number of separate parts, and thus we
will not suffer any loss of generality if we restrict our attention to circuits
for which S = 1.
    We are now ready to discuss a method by which we may write a set of
nodal equations that are independent and sufficient. The method will enable
us to obtain many different sets of equations for the same network, and all
the sets will be valid. However, the method does not provide us with every
possible set of equations. Let us first describe the procedure, illustrate it by
three examples, and then point out the reason that the equations are inde-
pendent and sufficient.
    Given a network, we should:

     1. Draw a graph and then identify a tree.
     2. Place all voltage sources in the tree.
     3. Place all current sources in the cotree.
     4. Place all control-voltage branches for voltage-controlled dependent
        sources in the tree, if possible.
     5. Place all control-current branches for current-controlled dependent
        sources in the cotree, if possible.


These last four steps effectively associate voltages with the tree and currents
with the cotree.
    We now assign a voltage variable (with its plus-minus pair) across each
of the (N − 1) branches in the tree. A branch containing a voltage source
(dependent or independent) should be assigned that source voltage, and a
branch containing a controlling voltage should be assigned that controlling
voltage. The number of new variables that we have introduced is therefore
equal to the number of branches in the tree (N − 1), reduced by the number
of voltage sources in the tree, and reduced also by the number of control
voltages we were able to locate in the tree. In Example A1.3, we will find
that the number of new variables required may be zero.
    Having a set of variables, we now need to write a set of equations that
are sufficient to determine these variables. The equations are obtained
through the application of KCL. Voltage sources are handled in the same
way that they were in our earlier attack on nodal analysis; each voltage
794              APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY


                 source and the two nodes at its terminals constitute a supernode or a part of
                 a supernode. Kirchhoff’s current law is then applied at all but one of the re-
                 maining nodes and supernodes. We set the sum of the currents leaving the
                 node in all of the branches connected to it equal to zero. Each current is ex-
                 pressed in terms of the voltage variables we just assigned. One node may be
                 ignored, just as was the case earlier for the reference node. Finally, in case
                 there are current-controlled dependent sources, we must write an equation
                 for each control current that relates it to the voltage variables; this also is no
                 different from the procedure used before with nodal analysis.
                     Let us try out this process on the circuit shown in Fig. A1.5a. It contains
                 four nodes and five branches, and its graph is shown in Fig. A1.5b.

                         the tree, while the current source goes in the cotree. (d )The tree is completed and a
                         voltage is assigned across each tree branch.

                  In accordance with steps 2 and 3 of the tree-drawing procedure, we
                  place the voltage source in the tree and the current source in the cotree.
                  Following step 4, we see that the vx branch may also be placed in the
                  tree, since it does not form any loop which would violate the definition
                  of a tree. We have now arrived at the two tree branches and the single
                  link shown in Fig. A1.5c, and we see that we do not yet have a tree,
                  since the right node is not connected to the others by a path through
                  tree branches. The only possible way to complete the tree is shown in
                  Fig. A1.5d. The 100 V source voltage, the control voltage vx , and a
                  new voltage variable v1 are next assigned to the three tree branches as
                  shown.
                      We therefore have two unknowns, vx and v1 , and we need to obtain
                  two equations in terms of them. There are four nodes, but the presence
                                                APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY                 795


of the voltage source causes two of them to form a single supernode.
Kirchhoff’s current law may be applied at any two of the three
remaining nodes or supernodes. Let’s attack the right node first. The
current leaving to the left is −v1 /15, while that leaving downward is
−vx /14. Thus, our first equation is
                                               v1   −vx
                                           −      +     =0
                                               15   14
The central node at the top looks easier than the supernode, and so we
set the sum of the current to the left (−vx /8), the current to the right
(v1 /15), and the downward current through the 4- resistor equal to
zero. This latter current is given by the voltage across the resistor
divided by 4 , but there is no voltage labeled on that link. However,
when a tree is constructed according to the definition, there is a path
through it from any node to any other node. Then, since every branch
in the tree is assigned a voltage, we may express the voltage across any
link in terms of the tree-branch voltages. This downward current is
therefore (−vx + 100)/4, and we have the second equation,
                                   vx   v1   −vx + 100
                              −       +    +           =0

The simultaneous solution of these two nodal equations gives

                                                               branch voltages are sufficient, then the voltage of every branch in either the

                                                               For the links we know that each link extends between two nodes, and, by
                                                               definition, the tree must also connect those two nodes. Hence, every link
                                                               voltage may also be established in terms of the tree-branch voltages.
                                                                   Once the voltage across every branch in the circuit is known, then all

                                                               determined and sufficiency is demonstrated.

    To demonstrate independency, let us satisfy ourselves by assuming the
situation where the only sources in the network are independent current
sources. As we have noticed earlier, independent voltage sources in the cir-
cuit result in fewer equations, while dependent sources usually necessitate a
greater number of equations. With independent current sources only, there
will then be precisely (N − 1) nodal equations written in terms of (N − 1)
tree-branch voltages. To show that these (N − 1) equations are independ-
ent, visualize the application of KCL to the (N − 1) different nodes. Each
time we write the KCL equation, there is a new tree branch involved—the
one which connects that node to the remainder of the tree. Since that circuit
element has not appeared in any previous equation, we must obtain an in-
dependent equation. This is true for each of the (N − 1) nodes in turn, and
hence we have (N − 1) independent equations.

A1.2        LINKS AND LOOP ANALYSIS
        •
Now we will consider the use of a tree to obtain a suitable set of loop
equations. In some respects this is the dual of the method of writing nodal
equations. Again it should be pointed out that, although we are able to guar-
antee that any set of equations we write will be both sufficient and inde-
pendent, we should not expect that the method will lead directly to every
possible set of equations.
    We again begin by constructing a tree, and we use the same set of rules
as we did for general nodal analysis. The objective for either nodal or loop
analysis is to place voltages in the tree and currents in the cotree; this is a
mandatory rule for sources and a desirable rule for controlling quantities.
    Now, however, instead of assigning a voltage to each branch in the tree,
we assign a current (including reference arrow, of course) to each element
in the cotree or to each link. If there were 10 links, we would assign exactly
10 link currents. Any link that contains a current source is assigned that
source current as the link current. Note that each link current may also be
798   APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY


      thought of as a loop current, for the link must extend between two specific
      nodes, and there must also be a path between those same two nodes through
      the tree. Thus, with each link there is associated a single specific loop that
      includes that one link and a unique path through the tree. It is evident that
      the assigned current may be thought of either as a loop current or as a link
      current. The link connotation is most helpful at the time the currents are be-
      ing defined, for one must be established for each link; the loop interpreta-
      tion is more convenient at equation-writing time, because we will apply
      KVL around each loop.
          Let us try out this process of defining link currents by considering the
      circuit shown in Fig. A1.9a. The tree selected is one of several that might be
      constructed for which the voltage source is in a tree branch and the current
      source is in a link. Let us first consider the link containing the current source.
      The loop associated with this link is the left-hand mesh, and so we show our
      link current flowing about the perimeter of this mesh (Fig. A1.9b). An obvi-
      ous choice for the symbol for this link current is ‘‘7 A.’’ Remember that no
      other current can flow through this particular link, and thus its value must be
      exactly the strength of the current source.

      ■ FIGURE A1.9 (a) A simple circuit. (b) A tree is chosen such that the
        current source is in a link and the voltage source is in a tree branch.

          We next turn our attention to the 3  resistor link. The loop associated
      with it is the upper right-hand mesh, and this loop (or mesh) current is
      defined as i A and also shown in Fig. A1.9b. The last link is the lower 1 
      resistor, and the only path between its terminals through the tree is around
      the perimeter of the circuit. That link current is called i B , and the arrow
      indicating its path and reference direction appears in Fig. A1.9b. It is not a
      mesh current.
          Note that each link has only one current present in it, but a tree branch
      may have any number from 1 to the total number of link currents assigned.
      The use of long, almost closed, arrows to indicate the loops helps to indicate
      which loop currents flow through which tree branch and what their refer-
      ence directions are.
          A KVL equation must now be written around each of these loops. The
      variables used are the assigned link currents. Since the voltage across a cur-
      rent source cannot be expressed in terms of the source current, and since we
      have already used the value of the source current as the link current, we dis-
      card any loop containing a current source.

For the example of Fig. A1.9, find the values of iA and iB.
We first traverse the i A loop, proceeding clockwise from its lower left
corner. The current going our way in the 1  resistor is (i A − 7), in the
2  element it is (i A + i B ), and in the link it is simply i B . Thus
                         1(i A − 7) + 2(i A + i B ) + 3i A = 0
For the i B link, clockwise travel from the lower left corner leads to
                            −7 + 2(i A + i B ) + 1i B = 0
Traversal of the loop defined by the 7 A link is not required. Solving,
we have i A = 0.5 A, i B = 2 A, once again. The solution has been
achieved with one less equation than before!

This circuit contains six nodes, and its tree therefore must have five
branches. Since there are eight elements in the network, there are three
links in the cotree. If we place the three voltage sources in the tree and
the two current sources and the current control in the cotree, we are led
to the tree shown in Fig. A1.10b. The source current of 4 A defines a

                                                          loop current 1.5i 1 around the right mesh, and the control current i 1
                                                          gives us the remaining loop current about the perimeter of the circuit.
                                                          Note that all three currents flow through the 4  resistor.
                                                             We have only one unknown quantity, i 1 , and after discarding the
                                                          loops defined by the two current sources, we apply KVL around the
                                                          outside of the circuit:
                                                             −30 + 5(−i 1 ) + 19 + 2(−i 1 − 4) + 4(−i 1 − 4 + 1.5i 1 ) − 25 = 0
                                                          Besides the three voltage sources, there are three resistors in this loop.
                                                          The 5  resistor has one loop current in it, since it is also a link; the
                                                          2  resistor contains two loop currents; and the 4  resistor has three.
                                                          A carefully drawn set of loop currents is a necessity if errors in
                                                          skipping currents, utilizing extra ones, or erring in choosing the correct
                                                          direction are to be avoided. The foregoing equation is guaranteed,
                                                          however, and it leads to i 1 = −12 A.



                                                             How may we demonstrate sufficiency? Let us visualize a tree. It con-
                                                         tains no loops and therefore contains at least two nodes to each of which
                  b                                      only one tree branch is connected. The current in each of these two branches
                                                         is easily found from the known link currents by applying KCL. If there are
                                             c           other nodes at which only one tree branch is connected, these tree-branch
              e                                          currents may also be immediately obtained. In the tree shown in Fig. A1.11,
          a           d            f
                                                         we thus have found the currents in branches a, b, c, and d. Now we move
                          g                              along the branches of the tree, finding the currents in tree branches e and f;
                                                         the process may be continued until all the branch currents are determined.
 ■ FIGURE A1.11 A tree that is used as an example        The link currents are therefore sufficient to determine all branch currents. It

                                                         is helpful to look at the situation where an incorrect ‘‘tree’’ has been drawn
                                                         which contains a loop. Even if all the link currents were zero, a current
                                                         might still circulate about this ‘‘tree loop.’’ Hence, the link currents could
                                                         not determine this current, and they would not represent a sufficient set.
                                                         Such a ‘‘tree’’ is by definition impossible.
                                                             To demonstrate independence, let us satisfy ourselves by assuming the
                                                         situation where the only sources in the network are independent voltage
                                                         sources. As we have noticed earlier, independent current sources in the cir-
                                                         cuit result in fewer equations, while dependent sources usually necessitate a
                                                         greater number of equations. If only independent voltage sources are pres-
                                                         ent, there will then be precisely (B − N + 1) loop equations written in
                                                         terms of the (B − N + 1) link currents. To show that these (B − N + 1)
                                                         loop equations are independent, it is necessary only to point out that each
                                                         represents the application of KVL around a loop which contains one link
                                                         not appearing in any other equation. We might visualize a different resis-
                                                         tance R1 , R2 , . . . , R B−N +1 in each of these links, and it is then apparent that
                                                         one equation can never be obtained from the others, since each contains one
                                                         coefficient not appearing in any other equation.
                                                             Hence, the link currents are sufficient to enable a complete solution to be
                                                         obtained, and the set of loop equations which we use to find the link currents
                                                         is a set of independent equations.

    Having looked at both general nodal analysis and loop analysis, we
should now consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method so
that an intelligent choice of a plan of attack can be made on a given analy-
sis problem.
    The nodal method in general requires (N − 1) equations, but this num-
ber is reduced by 1 for each independent or dependent voltage source in a
tree branch, and increased by 1 for each dependent source that is voltage-
controlled by a link voltage, or current-controlled.
    The loop method basically involves (B − N + 1) equations. However,
each independent or dependent current source in a link reduces this number
by 1, while each dependent source that is current-controlled by a tree-
branch current, or is voltage-controlled, increases the number by 1.
    As a grand finale for this discussion, let us inspect the T-equivalent
circuit model for a transistor shown in Fig. A1.12, to which is connected a
sinusoidal source, 4 sin 1000t mV, and a 10 k load.



                                                                                                    EXAMPLE A1.6

         ■ FIGURE A1.12 A sinusoidal voltage source and a 10 k load are
           connected to the T-equivalent circuit of a transistor. The common connection
           between the input and output is at the base terminal of the transistor, and the
           arrangement is called the common-base configuration.

 Although the details are requested in the practice problems that follow,
 we should see readily that the analysis of this circuit might be
 accomplished by drawing trees requiring three general nodal equations
 (N − 1 − 1 + 1) or two loop equations (B − N + 1 − 1). We might
 also note that three equations are required in terms of node-to-reference
 voltages, as are three mesh equations.
    No matter which method we choose, these results are obtained for
 this specific circuit:
                         i e = 18.42 sin 1000t                μA

       and we therefore find that this transistor circuit provides a voltage gain
       (v L /vs ) of 30.6, a current gain (v L /10,000i e ) of 0.666, and a power
       gain equal to the product 30.6(0.666) = 20.4. Higher gains could be
       secured by operating this transistor in a common-emitter configuration.

SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS
EQUATIONS

Consider the simple system of equations
                                7v1 − 3v2 − 4v3 = −11                     [1]

This set of equations could be solved by a systematic elimination of the
variables. Such a procedure is lengthy, however, and may never yield an-
swers if done unsystematically for a greater number of simultaneous equa-
tions. Fortunately, there are many more options available to us, some of
which we will explore in this appendix.

The Scientific Calculator
Perhaps the most straightforward approach when faced with a system of
equations such as Eqs. [1] to [3], in which we have numerical coefficients
and are only interested in the specific values of our unknowns (as opposed
to algebraic relationships), is to employ any of the various scientific calcu-
lators presently on the market. For example, on a Texas Instruments TI-84,
we can employ the Polynomial Root Finder and Simultaneous Equation
Solver (you may need to install the application using TI ConnectTM). Pressing
the APPS key and scrolling down, find the application named PLYSmlt2.

      pressing NEXT, we are presented with a screen similar to that shown in
      Fig. A2.1c. After we have finished entering all coefficients, pressing the
      SOLVE button yields the Solution screen depicted in Fig. A2.1d. Since
      we did not name the variables, a slight mental conversion is required to
      realize X 1 = v1 , X 2 = v2 , etc.
          It should be noted that each calculator capable of solving simultaneous
      equations has its own procedure for entering the required information—
      therefore, it is a good idea not to throw away anything marked ‘‘Owner’s
      Manual’’ or ‘‘Instructions,’’ no matter how tempting such an action might be.


      Matrices
      Another powerful approach to the solution of a system of equations is based
      on the concept of matrices. Consider Eqs. [1], [2], and [3]. The array of the
      constant coefficients of the equations,
                                     ⎡                ⎤
                                          7 −3 −4
                                G = ⎣ −3      6 −2 ⎦
                                         −4 −2        11

      is called a matrix; the symbol G has been selected since each element of the
      matrix is a conductance value. A matrix itself has no ‘‘value’’; it is merely
      an ordered array of elements. We use a letter in boldface type to represent a
      matrix, and we enclose the array itself by square brackets.
          A matrix having m rows and n columns is called an (m × n) (pronounced
      ‘‘m by n’’) matrix. Thus,
                                                    
                                           2 0 5
                                  A=

      is a (2 × 3) matrix, and the G matrix of our example is a (3 × 3) matrix. An
      (n × n) matrix is a square matrix of order n.
          An (m × 1) matrix is called a column matrix, or a vector. Thus,
                                            
                                             V1
                                      V=
                                             V2

      is a (2 × 1) column matrix of phasor voltages, and
                                           
                                            I1
                                      I=
                                            I2

      is a (2 × 1) phasor-current vector. A (1 × n) matrix is known as a row vector.
           Two (m × n) matrices are equal if their corresponding elements are
      equal. Thus, if a jk is that element of A located in row j and column k and
      b jk is the element at row j and column k in matrix B, then A = B if and only
      if a jk = b jk for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Thus, if
                                                         
                                   V1       z11 I1 + z12 I2
                                        =
                                   V2       z21 I1 + z22 I2

      then V1 = z11 I1 + z12 I2 and V2 = z21 I1 + z22 I2 .
                                  APPENDIX 2 SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS    805

   Two (m × n) matrices may be added by adding corresponding elements.
Thus,
                                                     
            2 0 5           1     2    3         3 2 8

           −1 6 3         −3 −2 −1             −4 4 2

Next let us consider the matrix product AB, where A is an (m × n) matrix
and B is a ( p × q) matrix. If n = p, the matrices are said to be conformal,
and their product exists. That is, matrix multiplication is defined only for the
case where the number of columns of the first matrix in the product is equal
to the number of rows in the second matrix.
    The formal definition of matrix multiplication states that the product of
the (m × n) matrix A and the (n × q) matrix B is an (m × q) matrix having
elements c jk , 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ k ≤ q, where
                    c jk = a j1 b1k + a j2 b2k + · · · + a jn bnk
That is, to find the element in the second row and third column of the prod-
uct, we multiply each of the elements in the second row of A by the corre-
sponding element in the third column of B and then add the n results. For
example, given the (2 × 3) matrix A and the (3 × 2) matrix B,
                         ⎡           ⎤
                       b11 b12
     a11 a12 a13 ⎣
                           b21 b22 ⎦ =
     a21 a22 a23
                           b31 b32
                                                                              
                 (a11 b11 + a12 b21 + a13 b31 ) (a11 b12 + a12 b22 + a13 b32 )
                 (a21 b11 + a22 b21 + a23 b31 ) (a21 b12 + a22 b22 + a23 b32 )

The result is a (2 × 2) matrix.
   As a numerical example of matrix multiplication, we take
                                ⎡       ⎤
                                 2  3                 
                   3    2 1 ⎣                   6      4
                                  −2 −1 ⎦ =
                 −2 −2 4                       16 −16
                                   4 −3
where 6 = (3)(2) + (2)(−2) + (1)(4), 4 = (3)(3) + (2)(−1) + (1)(−3),
and so forth.
   Matrix multiplication is not commutative. For example, given the
(3 × 2) matrix C and the (2 × 1) matrix D, it is evident that the product
CD may be calculated, but the product DC is not even defined.
   As a final example, let
                                        
                                     2 3

so that both t A t B and t B t A are defined. However,

      Matrix Inversion
      If we write our system of equations using matrix notation,
                        ⎡                ⎤⎡ ⎤ ⎡             ⎤
                            7 −3 −4          v1        −11
                        ⎣ −3      6 −2 ⎦ ⎣ v2 ⎦ = ⎣ 3 ⎦                           [4]
                           −4 −2 11          v3          25
      we may solve for the voltage vector by multiplying both sides of Eq. [4] by
      the inverse of our matrix G:
                         ⎡              ⎤⎡ ⎤             ⎡       ⎤
                            7 −3 −4          v1            −11
                    G−1 ⎣ −3      6 −2 ⎦ ⎣ v2 ⎦ = G−1 ⎣ 3 ⎦                   [5]
                           −4 −2 11          v3              25
      This procedure makes use of the identity G−1 G = I, where I is the identity
      matrix, a square matrix of the same size as G, with zeros everywhere except
      on the diagonal. Each element on the diagonal of an identity matrix is unity.
      Thus, Eq. [5] becomes
                        ⎡            ⎤⎡ ⎤             ⎡      ⎤
                           1 0 0         v1             −11
                        ⎣ 0 1 0 ⎦ ⎣ v2 ⎦ = G−1 ⎣ 3 ⎦
                           0 0 1         v3               25
      which may be simplified to
                              ⎡         ⎤       ⎡     ⎤
                                     v1           −11
                                   ⎣ v2 ⎦ = G−1 ⎣ 3 ⎦
                                     v3            25
      since the identity matrix times any vector is simply equal to that vector (the
      proof is left to the reader as a 30-second exercise). The solution of our system
      of equations has therefore been transformed into the problem of obtaining the
      inverse matrix of G. Many scientific calculators provide the means of per-
      forming matrix algebra.

    Returning to the TI-84, we press 2ND and MATRIX to obtain the
screen shown in Fig. A2.2a. Scrolling horizontally to EDIT, we press the
ENTER key, and select a 3 × 3 matrix, resulting in a screen similar to that
shown in Fig. A2.2b. Once we have finished entering the matrix, we press
2ND and QUIT. Returning to the MATRIX editor, we create a 3  1 vec-
tor named B, as shown in Fig. A2.2c. We are now (finally) ready to solve for
the solution vector. Pressing 2ND and MATRIX, under NAMES we select
[A] and press ENTER, followed by the x−1 key. Next, we select [B] the
same way (we could have pressed the multiplication key in between but it is
not necessary). The result of our calculation is shown in Fig. A2.2d, and
agrees with our earlier exercise.

Determinants
Although a matrix itself has no ‘‘value,’’ the determinant of a square ma-
trix does have a value. To be precise, we should say that the determinant of
a matrix is a value, but common usage enables us to speak of both the array
itself and its value as the determinant. We shall symbolize a determinant
by , and employ a suitable subscript to denote the matrix to which the
determinant refers. Thus,
                                                                  
                                          7 −3                −4 
                                                                  
                                   G =  −3  6               −2 
                                          −4 −2               11 

Note that simple vertical lines are used to enclose the determinant.
   The value of any determinant is obtained by expanding it in terms of its
minors. To do this, we select any row j or any column k, multiply each el-
ement in that row or column by its minor and by (−1) j+k , and then add the
products. The minor of the element appearing in both row j and column k
808   APPENDIX 2 SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS


      is the determinant obtained when row j and column k are removed; it is
      indicated by  jk .
          As an example, let us expand the determinant G along column 3. We
      first multiply the (−4) at the top of this column by (−1)1+3 = 1 and then by
      its minor:
                                                  −3  6
                                   (−4)(−1)1+3
                                                  −4 −2
      and then repeat for the other two elements in column 3, adding the results:
                           −3  6     7 −3       7 −3
                    −4           +2       + 11
                           −4 −2    −4 −2      −3  6
      The minors contain only two rows and two columns. They are of order 2, and
      their values are easily determined by expanding in terms of minors again,
      here a trivial operation. Thus, for the first determinant, we expand along the
      first column by multiplying (−3) by (−1)1+1 and its minor, which is merely
      the element (−2), and then multiplying (−4) by (−1)2+1 and by 6. Thus,

                            −3  6
                                  = (−3)(−2) − 4(−6) = 30
                            −4 −2

      It is usually easier to remember the result for a second-order determinant as
      ‘‘upper left times lower right minus upper right times lower left.’’ Finally,

                             G = −4[(−3)(−2) − 6(−4)]
                                  + 2[(7)(−2) − (−3)(−4)]
                                  + 11[(7)(6) − (−3)(−3)]
                                = −4(30) + 2(−26) + 11(33)
                                = 191

      For practice, let us expand this same determinant along the first row:
                           6 −2        −3 −2        −3  6
              G = 7            − (−3)       + (−4)
                          −2 11        −4 11        −4 −2
                  = 7(62) + 3(−41) − 4(30)
                  = 191
      The expansion by minors is valid for a determinant of any order.
         Repeating these rules for evaluating a determinant in more general
      terms, we would say, given a matrix a,
                                ⎡                       ⎤
                                  a11 a12 . . . a1N
                                ⎢                       ⎥
                           a = ⎣ a21 a22 . . . a2N ⎦

      that a may be obtained by expansion in terms of minors along any row j :

          a = a j1 (−1) j+1  j1 + a j2 (−1) j+2  j2 + · · · + a j N (−1) j+N  j N

or along any column k:
    a = a1k (−1)1+k 1k + a2k (−1)2+k 2k + · · · + a N k (−1) N +k  N k
              N
          =         ank (−1)n+k nk
              n=1

The cofactor C jk of the element appearing in both row j and column k is
simply (−1) j+k times the minor  jk . Thus, C11 = 11 , but C12 = −12 .
We may now write
                                  N                   N
                           a =         a jn C jn =         ank Cnk
                                  n=1                 n=1

As an example, let us consider this fourth-order determinant:
                                2 −1 −2  0
                               −1  4  2 −3
                            =
                               −2 −1  5 −1
                                0 −3  3  2
We find
         4             2   −3
  11 = −1             5   −1 = 4(10 + 3) + 1(4 + 9) − 3(−2 + 15) = 26

        −1             2   −3
  12 = −2             5   −1 = −1(10 + 3) + 2(4 + 9) + 0 = 13
         0             3    2
and C11 = 26, whereas C12 = −13. Finding the value of  for practice, we
have
              = 2C11 + (−1)C12 + (−2)C13 + 0
               = 2(26) + (−1)(−13) + (−2)(3) + 0 = 59



Cramer’s Rule
We next consider Cramer’s rule, which enables us to find the values of the
unknown variables. It is also useful in solving systems of equations where
numerical coefficients have not yet been specified, thus confounding our
calculators. Let us again consider Eqs. [1], [2], and [3]; we define the deter-
minant 1 as that determinant which is obtained when the first column of
G is replaced by the three constants on the right-hand sides of the three
equations. Thus,
                                        −11 −3 −4
                              1 =        3  6 −2
                                         25 −2 11
We expand along the first column:
                          6 −2        −3 −4      −3 −4
          1 = −11                −3        + 25
                         −2 11        −2 11       6 −2
                  = −682 + 123 + 750 = 191

A PROOF OF THÉVENIN’S
THEOREM

Here we prove Thévenin’s theorem in the same form in which it is stated in
Sec. 5.4 of Chap. 5:

  Given any linear circuit, rearrange it in the form of two networks A and
  B connected by two wires. Define a voltage voc as the open-circuit volt-
  age which appears across the terminals of A when B is disconnected.
  Then all currents and voltages in B will remain unchanged if all inde-
  pendent voltage and current sources in A are ‘‘killed’’ or ‘‘zeroed out,’’
  and an independent voltage source voc is connected, with proper polar-
  ity, in series with the dead (inactive) A network.

We will effect our proof by showing that the original A network and the
Thévenin equivalent of the A network both cause the same current to flow
into the terminals of the B network. If the currents are the same, then the
voltages must be the same; in other words, if we apply a certain current,
which we might think of as a current source, to the B network, then the cur-
rent source and the B network constitute a circuit that has a specific input
voltage as a response. Thus, the current determines the voltage. Alterna-
tively we could, if we wished, show that the terminal voltage at B is
unchanged, because the voltage also determines the current uniquely. If the
input voltage and current to the B network are unchanged, then it follows
that the currents and voltages throughout the B network are also unchanged.
    Let us first prove the theorem for the case where the B network is inactive
(no independent sources). After this step has been accomplished, we may then
use the superposition principle to extend the theorem to include B networks
that contain independent sources. Each network may contain dependent
sources, provided that their control variables are in the same network.
    The current i , flowing in the upper conductor from the A network to the
B network in Fig. A3.1a, is therefore caused entirely by the independent

                       i                                                   vx     0                                                      i

                     (a)                                                   (b)                                                  (c)

  the same part of the network. (b) The Thévenin source is inserted in the circuit and adjusted until i = 0. No voltage appears across network B and thus

                                                             sources present in the A network. Suppose now that we add an additional
                                                             voltage source vx , which we shall call the Thévenin source, in the conduc-
                                                             tor in which i is measured, as shown in Fig. A3.1b, and then adjust the mag-
                                                             nitude and time variation of vx until the current is reduced to zero. By our
                                                             definition of voc , then, the voltage across the terminals of A must be voc ,
                                                             since i = 0. Network B contains no independent sources, and no current is
                                                             entering its terminals; therefore, there is no voltage across the terminals of
                                                             the B network, and by Kirchhoff’s voltage law the voltage of the Thévenin
                                                             source is voc volts, vx = voc . Moreover, since the Thévenin source and the
                                                             A network jointly deliver no current to B, and since the A network by itself
                                                             delivers a current i , superposition requires that the Thévenin source acting
                                                             by itself must deliver a current of −i to B. The source acting alone in a
                                                             reversed direction, as shown in Fig. A3.1c, therefore produces a current i in
                                                             the upper lead. This situation, however, is the same as the conclusion
                                                             reached by Thévenin’s theorem: the Thévenin source voc acting in series
                                                             with the inactive A network is equivalent to the given network.
                                                                 Now let us consider the case where the B network may be an active net-
                                                             work. We now think of the current i , flowing from the A network to the B
                                                             network in the upper conductor, as being composed of two parts, i A and i B ,
                                                             where i A is the current produced by A acting alone and the current i B is due
                                                             to B acting alone. Our ability to divide the current into these two compo-
                                                             nents is a direct consequence of the applicability of the superposition
                                                             principle to these two linear networks; the complete response and the two

                                                             keep in mind—those in A, those in B, and the Thévenin source—the partial

                                                             Preparing for the use of superposition, we now let A remain inactive, but
                                                             turn on B and turn off the Thévenin source; by definition, the partial re-

                                                             dead and both the Thévenin source and B are active is i A + i B . This sum is

A PSpice® TUTORIAL

SPICE is an acronym for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit
Emphasis. A powerful program, it is an industry standard and used through-
out the world for a variety of circuit analysis applications. SPICE was origi-
nally developed in the early 1970s by Donald O. Peterson and coworkers at
the University of California at Berkeley. Interestingly, Peterson advocated
free and unhindered distribution of knowledge created in university labs,
choosing to make an impact as opposed to profiting financially. In 1984,
MicroSim Corporation introduced a PC version of SPICE called PSpice®,
which built intuitive graphical interfaces around the core SPICE software
routines. There are now several variations of SPICE available commercially,
as well as competing software products.
    The goal of this appendix is to simply introduce the basics of computer-
aided circuit analysis; more details are presented in the main text as well as
in the references listed under Reading Further. Advanced topics covered in
the references include how to determine the sensitivity of an output variable
to changes in a specific component value; how to obtain plots of the output
versus a source value; determining ac output as a function of source fre-
quency; methods for performing noise and distortion analyses; nonlinear
component models; and how to model temperature effects on specific types
of circuits.
    The acquisition of MicroSim by OrCAD, and the subsequent acquisition
of OrCAD by Cadence, has led to quite a few changes in this popular cir-
cuit simulation package. At the time of this writing, OrCAD Capture
CIS-Demo 16.3, is the current professional release; a scaled-back version is
available for free download (www.cadence.com). This new version
replaces the popular PSpice Student Release 9.1, and although slightly dif-
ferent, particularly in terms of the schematic editing, should seem generally
familiar to users of previous PSpice releases.
    The documentation which accompanies the demo version of OrCAD 16.3
lists several restrictions that do not apply to the professional (commercially
available) version. The most significant is that only circuits having 60 or
fewer parts may be saved and simulated; larger circuits can be drawn and
viewed, however. We have chosen to work with the OrCAD Capture
schematics editor, as the current version is very similar fundamentally to the
PSpice A/D Schematic Capture editor. Although at present Cadence also
provides PSpice A/D for download, it is no longer supported.

Getting Started
A computer-aided circuit analysis consists of three separate steps: (1) draw-
ing the schematic, (2) simulating the circuit, and (3) extracting the desired
information from the simulation output. The OrCAD Capture schematic

    At this point, we’re ready to draw a circuit, so let’s try a simple voltage
divider for purposes of illustration. We will first place the necessary com-
ponents on the grid, and then wire them together.
    Pulling down the Place menu, we choose Part. Typing a lowercase ‘‘r’’
as shown, we click OK and are now able to move a resistor symbol around
the schematic window using the mouse. A single left click places a resistor
(named R1) at the mouse location; a second left click places a second resis-
tor on our schematic (named R2). A single right click and selecting End
Mode cancel further resistor placements. The second resistor does not have
the appropriate orientation, but is easily manipulated by highlighting it with
a single right click, then selecting Rotate. If we do not know the name of
the desired part, we can browse through the library of parts provided. If
1 k resistors are not desired—for example, perhaps two 500  resistors
were called for—we change the default values simply by double-clicking
the ‘‘1k’’ next to the appropriate symbol.
    No voltage divider circuit is complete of course without a voltage source
(vsrc). Double-clicking DC=, we choose a value of 9 V for our source. One
further component is required: SPICE requires a reference (or ground) node to
be specified. Clicking the GND symbol to the far right of the schematic win-
dow, we choose 0/Source from the options. Our progress so far is shown in
Fig. A4.4a; all that remains is to wire the components together. This is
accomplished by selecting the Place wire (W) icon. The left and right mouse
keys control each wire (some experimenting is called for here—afterward, se-
lect any unwanted wire segments and hit the Delete key). Our final circuit is
shown in Fig. A4.4b. It is worth noting that the editor will allow the user to wire
through a resistor (thus shorting it out), which can be difficult to see. Generally
a warning symbol appears before wiring to an inappropriate location.
    Prior to simulating our circuit, we save it by clicking the save icon or
selecting Save from the File menu. From the PSpice menu, we select New
Simulation Profile, and type Voltage Divider in the dialog box that appears.

                      The Simulation Settings dialog box that appears allows us to set parameters
                      for a variety of types of simulations; for the present example we need to select
                      Bias Point under the Analysis type menu. Once again pulling down the
                      PSpice menu, we select Run. The simulation results are shown in Fig. A4.5.

                         Fortunately, our simulation yields the expected result—an even split of
                      our source voltage across the two equal-valued resistors. We can also view
                      the simulation results by selecting View Output File under the PSpice
                      menu. Scrolling down to the end of this file, we see the following lines:

                      where node 109 is the positive reference of our voltage source, and node 116
                      is the junction between the two resistors. This information is available at the
                      top of the file.

COMPLEX NUMBERS

This appendix includes sections covering the definition of a complex num-
ber, the basic arithmetic operations for complex numbers, Euler’s identity,
and the exponential and polar forms of the complex number. We first intro-
duce the concept of a complex number.



A5.1 THE COMPLEX NUMBER
       •
Our early training in mathematics dealt exclusively with real numbers, such
as 4, − 27 , and π . Soon, however, we began to encounter algebraic equations,
such as x 2 = −3, which could not be satisfied by any real number. Such an
equation can be solved only through the introduction of the imaginary unit,
or the imaginary operator, which we    √ shall designate by the symbol j . By      Mathematicians designate the imaginary operator by
definition, j 2 = −1, and thus j = −1, j 3 = − j , j 4 = 1, and so forth.
                                                                                   the symbol i , but it is customary to use j in electrical
The product of a real number and the imaginary operator is called an imag-
                                                                                   engineering in order to avoid confusion with the
inary number, and the sum of a real number and an imaginary number is
                                                                                   symbol for current.
called a complex number. Thus, a number having the form a + jb, where a
and b are real numbers, is a complex number.
    We shall designate a complex number by means of a special single sym-          The choice of the words imaginary and complex
bol; thus, A = a + jb. The complex nature of the number is indicated by            is unfortunate. They are used here and in the
the use of boldface type; in handwritten material, a bar over the letter is cus-   mathematical literature as technical terms to designate
tomary. The complex number A just shown is described as having a real              a class of numbers. To interpret imaginary as ‘‘not
component or real part a and an imaginary component or imaginary part b.           pertaining to the physical world’’ or complex as
This is also expressed as                                                          ‘‘complicated’’ is neither justified nor intended.
                         Re{A} = a        Im{A} = b
The imaginary component of A is not jb. By definition, the imaginary com-
ponent is a real number.
    It should be noted that all real numbers may be regarded as complex
numbers having imaginary parts equal to zero. The real numbers are there-
fore included in the system of complex numbers, and we may now consider
them as a special case. When we define the fundamental arithmetic opera-
tions for complex numbers, we should therefore expect them to reduce to
the corresponding definitions for real numbers if the imaginary part of every
complex number is set equal to zero.
    Since any complex number is completely characterized by a pair of real
numbers, such as a and b in the previous example, we can obtain some
visual assistance by representing a complex number graphically on a rec-
tangular, or Cartesian, coordinate system. By providing ourselves with a real
axis and an imaginary axis, as shown in Fig. A5.1, we form a complex
plane, or Argand diagram, on which any complex number can be repre-
sented as a single point. The complex numbers M = 3 + j1 and N = 2 − j2

      a visual aid; it is not at all essential to the mathematical statements which
      follow.

          We define two complex numbers as being equal if, and only if, their real
      parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Graphically, then, to
      each point in the complex plane there corresponds only one complex num-
      ber, and conversely, to each complex number there corresponds only one
      point in the complex plane. Thus, suppose we are given the two complex
      numbers
                               A = a + jb               and          B = c + jd
      Then, if
                                                    A=B
      it is necessary that
                                            a=c         and          b=d
      A complex number expressed as the sum of a real number and an imaginary
      number, such as A = a + jb, is said to be in rectangular or cartesian form.
      Other forms for a complex number will appear shortly.
          Let us now define the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, and division for complex numbers. The sum of two complex
      numbers is defined as the complex number whose real part is the sum of the
      real parts of the two complex numbers and whose imaginary part is the sum
      of the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers. Thus,
                           (a + jb) + (c + jd) = (a + c) + j (b + d)
      For example,
                                       (3 + j4) + (4 − j2) = 7 + j2
      The difference of two complex numbers is taken in a similar manner; for
      example,
                                   (3 + j4) − (4 − j2) = −1 + j6

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers may also be accomplished                  Imaginary
graphically on the complex plane. Each complex number is represented as
a vector, or directed line segment, and the sum is obtained by completing
the parallelogram, illustrated by Fig. A5.2a, or by connecting the vectors in                               M
a head-to-tail manner, as shown in Fig. A5.2b. A graphical sketch is often

useful as a check for a more exact numerical solution.
    The product of two complex numbers is defined by                                                                     M + N = 5 – j1

               (a + jb)(c + jd) = (ac − bd) + j (bc + ad)                                             N

This result may be easily obtained by a direct multiplication of the two
                                                                                                             (a)
binomial terms, using the rules of the algebra of real numbers, and then
simplifying the result by letting j 2 = −1. For example,
                                                                                        Imaginary

                 (3 + j4)(4 − j2) = 12 − j6 + j16 − 8 j
                                  = 12 + j10 + 8                                                              M
                                  = 20 + j10
                                                                                                                                   Real
                                                                                                                           N
It is easier to multiply the complex numbers by this method, particularly if
we immediately replace j 2 by −1, than it is to substitute in the general for-                                     M + N = 5 – j1
mula that defines the multiplication.
     Before defining the operation of division for complex numbers, we
should define the conjugate of a complex number. The conjugate of the                                        (b)
complex number A = a + jb is a − jb and is represented as A∗ . The con-            ■ FIGURE A5.2 (a) The sum of the complex
jugate of any complex number is therefore easily obtained by merely chang-           numbers M = 3 + j 1 and N = 2 − j 2 is obtained

                                                                                     same two complex numbers is found by a head-to-tail
                                 A = 5 + j3                                          combination.
then
                                A∗ = 5 − j3

It is evident that the conjugate of any complicated complex expression may
be found by replacing every complex term in the expression by its conju-
gate, which may be obtained by replacing every j in the expression by − j .
     The definitions of addition, subtraction, and multiplication show that the
following statements are true: the sum of a complex number and its conju-
gate is a real number; the difference of a complex number and its conjugate
is an imaginary number; and the product of a complex number and its
conjugate is a real number. It is also evident that if A∗ is the conjugate of A,
then A is the conjugate of A∗ ; in other words, A = (A∗ )∗ . A complex
number and its conjugate are said to form a conjugate complex pair of
numbers.                                                                             Inevitably in a physical problem a complex number is
     We now define the quotient of two complex numbers:                              somehow accompanied by its conjugate.

                                B   (B)(B∗ )

and thus

                           =

          We multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the de-
      nominator in order to obtain a denominator which is real; this process is
      called rationalizing the denominator. As a numerical example,

                                    =

      The addition or subtraction of two complex numbers which are each ex-
      pressed in rectangular form is a relatively simple operation; multiplication
      or division of two complex numbers in rectangular form, however, is a
      rather unwieldy process. These latter two operations will be found to be
      much simpler when the complex numbers are given in either exponential or
      polar form. These forms will be introduced in Secs. A5.3 and A5.4.

      A5.2 EULER’S IDENTITY
             •
      In Chap. 9 we encounter functions of time which contain complex numbers,
      and we are concerned with the differentiation and integration of these func-
      tions with respect to the real variable t. We differentiate and integrate such
      functions with respect to t by exactly the same procedures we use for real
      functions of time. That is, the complex constants are treated just as though
      they were real constants when performing the operations of differentiation
      or integration. If f(t) is a complex function of time, such as
                                f(t) = a cos ct + jb sin ct
      then
                             df(t)
                                   = −ac sin ct + jbc cos ct
                              dt
      and
                         
                                         a           b

      where the constant of integration C is a complex number in general.
         It is sometimes necessary to differentiate or integrate a function of a
      complex variable with respect to that complex variable. In general, the
      successful accomplishment of either of these operations requires that the
                                                       APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS    821

function which is to be differentiated or integrated satisfy certain condi-
tions. All our functions do meet these conditions, and integration or differ-
entiation with respect to a complex variable is achieved by using methods
identical to those used for real variables.
    At this time we must make use of a very important fundamental rela-
tionship known as Euler’s identity (pronounced ‘‘oilers’’). We shall prove
this identity, for it is extremely useful in representing a complex number in
a form other than rectangular form.
    The proof is based on the power series expansions of cos θ , sin θ , and e z ,
given toward the back of your favorite college calculus text:
                                   θ2   θ4   θ6
                      cos θ = 1 −     +    −    + ···

                       sin θ = θ −    +    −    + ···
                                   3!   5!   7!
or
                                         θ2   θ3 θ4    θ5
          cos θ + j sin θ = 1 + jθ −        −j +    + j − ···

                                   2! 3! 4! 5!
so that
                                        θ2   θ3 θ4
                    e jθ = 1 + jθ −        −j +    + ···
                                        2!   3! 4!
We conclude that
                             e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ                           [1]
or, if we let z = − jθ , we find that
                            e− jθ = cos θ − j sin θ                           [2]
By adding and subtracting Eqs. [1] and [2], we obtain the two expressions
which we use without proof in our study of the underdamped natural
response of the parallel and series RLC circuits,
                          cos θ = 12 (e jθ + e− jθ )                          [3]

      A5.3 THE EXPONENTIAL FORM
             •
      Let us now take Euler’s identity
                                    e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ
      and multiply each side by the real positive number C:
                                Ce jθ = C cos θ + jC sin θ                      [5]
      The right-hand side of Eq. [5] consists of the sum of a real number and an
      imaginary number and thus represents a complex number in rectangular
      form; let us call this complex number A, where A = a + jb. By equating
      the real parts
                                        a = C cos θ                             [6]
      and the imaginary parts
                                         b = C sin θ                            [7]
      then squaring and adding Eqs. [6] and [7],
                                        a 2 + b2 = C 2
      or
                                           
                                      C = + a 2 + b2                            [8]
      and dividing Eq. [7] by Eq. [6]:
                                          b
                                            = tan θ
                                          a
      or
                                                    b
                                        θ = tan−1                               [9]
                                                    a
      we obtain the relationships of Eqs. [8] and [9], which enable us to determine
      C and θ from a knowledge of a and b. For example, if A = 4 + j2, then we
      identify a as 4 and b as 2 and find C and θ :
                                       
                                 C = 42 + 22 = 4.47
                                    θ = tan−1 42 = 26.6◦
      We could use this new information to write A in the form
                         A = 4.47 cos 26.6◦ + j4.47 sin 26.6◦
      but it is the form of the left-hand side of Eq. [5] which will prove to be the
      more useful:
                                                             ◦
                                   A = Ce jθ = 4.47e j26.6
      A complex number expressed in this manner is said to be in exponential
      form. The real positive multiplying factor C is known as the amplitude or
      magnitude, and the real quantity θ appearing in the exponent is called the
      argument or angle. A mathematician would always express θ in radians and
      would write
                                       A = 4.47e j0.464

but engineers customarily work in terms of degrees. The use of the degree
symbol (◦ ) in the exponent should make confusion impossible.
   To recapitulate, if we have a complex number which is given in rectan-
gular form,
                                 A = a + jb

and wish to express it in exponential form,

                                  A = Ce jθ

we may find C and θ by Eqs. [8] and [9]. If we are given the complex num-
ber in exponential form, then we may find a and b by Eqs. [6] and [7].
    When A is expressed in terms of numerical values, the transformation
between exponential (or polar) and rectangular forms is available as a built-
in operation on most handheld scientific calculators.
    One question will be found to arise in the determination of the angle θ
by using the arctangent relationship of Eq. [9]. This function is multivalued,
and an appropriate angle must be selected from various possibilities. One
method by which the choice may be made is to select an angle for which the
sine and cosine have the proper signs to produce the required values of a
and b from Eqs. [6] and [7]. For example, let us convert

                                 V = 4 − j3

to exponential form. The amplitude is
                                                                                   Imaginary
                         C = 42 + (−3)2 = 5
and the angle is
                                                                                             C = a2 + b2
                                 θ = tan−1 −3
                                           4                                [10]                                          b = C sin ␪
                                                                                                    ␪
A value of θ has to be selected which leads to a positive value for cos θ , since                                                       Real
                                                                                                    a = C cos ␪
4 = 5 cos θ , and a negative value for sin θ , since −3 = 5 sin θ . We therefore

    A simpler method of selecting the correct angle is available if we repre-

824   APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS


           If the rectangular form of the complex number has a negative real part,
      it is often easier to work with the negative of the complex number, thus
      avoiding angles greater than 90◦ in magnitude. For example, given
                                               I = −5 + j2
      we write
                                           I = −(5 − j2)
      and then transform (5 − j2) to exponential form:
                                               I = −Ce jθ
      where
                        √
                  C=     29 = 5.39              and      θ = tan−1 −2
                                                                   5
                                                                      = −21.8◦
      We therefore have
                                                                  ◦
                                         I = −5.39e− j21.8
      The negative sign may be removed from the complex number by increasing
      or decreasing the angle by 180◦ , as shown by reference to a sketch in the
      complex plane. Thus, the result may be expressed in exponential form as
                                           ◦                                     ◦
                        I = 5.39e j158.2            or      I = 5.39e− j201.8
      Note that use of an electronic calculator in the inverse tangent mode always
      yields angles having magnitudes less than 90◦ . Thus, both tan−1 [(−3)/4] and
      tan−1 [3/(−4)] come out as −36.9◦ . Calculators that provide rectangular-to-
      polar conversion, however, give the correct angle in all cases.
          One last remark about the exponential representation of a complex num-
      ber should be made. Two complex numbers, both written in exponential
      form, are equal if, and only if, their amplitudes are equal and their angles are
      equivalent. Equivalent angles are those which differ by multiples of 360◦ .
      For example, if A = Ce jθ and B = De jφ , then if A = B, it is necessary that
      C = D and θ = φ ± (360◦ )n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .

       11.19 − j34.4; −4.01 − j2.99.




      A5.4 THE POLAR FORM
              •
      The third (and last) form in which we may represent a complex number is
      essentially the same as the exponential form, except for a slight difference
      in symbolism. We use an angle sign (/ ) to replace the combination e j. Thus,
                                                         APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS   825

the exponential representation of a complex number A,
                                    A = Ce jθ
may be written somewhat more concisely as
                                    A = C/θ
The complex number is now said to be expressed in polar form, a name
which suggests the representation of a point in a (complex) plane through
the use of polar coordinates.
    It is apparent that transformation from rectangular to polar form or from
polar form to rectangular form is basically the same as transformation
between rectangular and exponential form. The same relationships exist
between C, θ , a, and b.
    The complex number
                                  A = −2 + j5
is thus written in exponential form as
                                                 ◦
                                 A = 5.39e j111.8

and in polar form as

                                A = 5.39/111.8◦

In order to appreciate the utility of the exponential and polar forms, let us
consider the multiplication and division of two complex numbers repre-
sented in exponential or polar form. If we are given
                A = 5/53.1◦           and       B = 15/−36.9◦

then the expression of these two complex numbers in exponential form
                             ◦                                  ◦
                 A = 5e j53.1         and       B = 15e− j36.9

enables us to write the product as a complex number in exponential form
whose amplitude is the product of the amplitudes and whose angle is the
algebraic sum of the angles, in accordance with the normal rules for multi-
plying two exponential quantities:
                                                     ◦    ◦
                       (A)(B) = (5)(15)e j (53.1 −36.9 )

or
                                            ◦
                        AB = 75e j16.2 = 75/16.2◦

From the definition of the polar form, it is evident that
                                 A
                                   = 0.333/90◦
                                 B
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are accomplished most eas-
ily by operating on complex numbers in rectangular form, and the addition
or subtraction of two complex numbers given in exponential or polar form
should begin with the conversion of the two complex numbers to rectangu-
lar form. The reverse situation applies to multiplication and division; two
826   APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS


      numbers given in rectangular form should be transformed to polar form, un-
      less the numbers happen to be small integers. For example, if we wish to
      multiply (1 − j3) by (2 + j1), it is easier to multiply them directly as they
      stand and obtain (5 − j5). If the numbers can be multiplied mentally, then
      time is wasted in transforming them to polar form.
          We should now endeavor to become familiar with the three different
      forms in which complex numbers may be expressed and with the rapid con-
      version from one form to another. The relationships among the three forms
      seem almost endless, and the following lengthy equation summarizes the
      various interrelationships
                                                                      −1
            A = a + jb = Re{A} + jIm{A} = Ce jθ = a 2 + b2 e j tan (b/a)
                 
              = a 2 + b2 /tan−1 (b/a)
      Most of the conversions from one form to another can be done quickly with
      the help of a calculator, and many calculators are equipped to solve linear
      equations with complex numbers.
          We shall find that complex numbers are a convenient mathematical arti-
      fice which facilitates the analysis of real physical situations.

A BRIEF MATLAB® TUTORIAL

The intention of this tutorial is to provide a very brief introduction to some
basic concepts required to use a powerful software package known as
MATLAB. The use of MATLAB is a completely optional part of the mate-
rial in this textbook, but as it is becoming an increasingly common tool in
all areas of electrical engineering, we felt that it was worthwhile to provide
students with the opportunity to begin exploring some of its features, par-
ticularly in plotting 2D and 3D functions, performing matrix operations,
solving simultaneous equations, and manipulating algebraic expressions.
Many institutions now provide the full version of MATLAB for their stu-
dents, but at the time of this writing, a student version is available at
reduced cost from The MathWorks, Inc. (http://www.mathworks.com/
academia/student_version/).

Getting Started
MATLAB is launched by clicking on the program icon; the typical opening
window is shown in Fig. A6.1. Programs may be run from files or by
directly entering commands in the window. MATLAB also has extensive
online help resources, useful for both beginners and advanced users alike.
Typical MATLAB programs very much resemble programs written in C,
although familiarity with this language is by no means required.

                                                            Variables and Mathematical Operations
                                                            MATLAB makes a great deal more sense once the user realizes that all vari-

                                                            to 19 characters in length, which is extremely useful in constructing pro-
                                                            grams with adequate readability. The first character must be a letter, but all
                                                            remaining characters can be any letter or number; the underscore (_)
                                                            character may also be used. Variable names in MATLAB are case-sensitive.
                                                            MATLAB includes several predefined variables. Relevant predefined vari-

                                                                                               2 −1
                                                            we would express the matrix t = 3 0 in MATLAB as

                                                                                      EDU» t = [2       − 1; 3 0];
                                                            Note that the matrix elements are entered a row at a time; row elements are
                                                            separated by a space, and rows are separated by a semicolon (;). The same
                                                            arithmetic operations are available for matrices; so, for example, we may
                                                            find t + t as

Arithmetic operators include:

   /             right (ordinary) division           −            subtraction



The order of operations is important. The order of precedence is power, then
multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction.

The concept of left division may seem strange at first, but is very useful in
matrix algebra. For example,
                                     EDU» 1/5
                                     ans =

And, in the case of the matrix equation Ax = B, where
                                                 

                           1 6                    2

we find x with

                                     EDU» B = [−1; 2];

Alternatively, we can also write

      When in doubt, parentheses can help a great deal.

      Some Useful Functions
      Space requirements prevent us from listing every function contained in
      MATLAB. Some of the more basic ones include:


           abs(x)      |x|         log 10(x)      log10 x
           exp(x)      ex          sin(x)         sin x         asin(x)        sin−1 x
                       √
           sqrt(x)        x        cos(x)         cos x         acos(x)        cos−1 x
           log(x)      ln x        tan(x)         tan x         atan(x)        tan−1 x


      Functions useful for manipulating complex variables include:

           real(s)                                  Re{s}
           imag(s)                                  Im{s}
                                                    √
           abs(s)                                     a 2 + b2 , where s ≡ a + jb
           angle(s)                                 tan−1 (b/a), where s ≡ a + jb
           conj(s)                                  complex conjugate of s


      Another extremely useful command, often forgotten, is simply help.
          Occasionally we require a vector, such as when we plan to create a plot.
      The command linspace(min, max, number of points) is invaluable in such
      instances:
                              EDU» frequency = linspace(0,10,5)
                              frequency =
                                  0   2.5000   5.0000       7.5000   10.0000
      A useful cousin is the command logspace().

      Generating Plots
      Plotting with MATLAB is extremely easy. For example, Fig. A6.2 shows
      the result of executing the following MATLAB program:
                               EDU» x = linspace(0,2*pi,100);
                               EDU» y = sin(x);
                               EDU» plot(x,y);
                               EDU» xlabel('Angle (radians)');
                               EDU» ylabel('f(x)');

Writing Programs
Although the MATLAB examples in this text are presented as lines typed
into the Command Window, it is possible (and often prudent, if repetition
is an issue) to write a program so that calculations are more convenient.
This is accomplished in MATLAB by writing what is termed an m-file.
This is simply a text file saved with a ‘‘.m’’ extension (for example,
first_program.m). In a nod to Kernighan and Ritchie, we pull down New
Script under the File menu, which opens up the editor. (Note that you can
use another editor, for example, WordPad, if you prefer.)
    We type in
                                  r = input('Hello, World')
as shown in Fig. A6.3.




■ FIGURE A6.3 Example m-file created in m-file editor.
832   APPENDIX 6 A BRIEF MATLAB® TUTORIAL


      We next save it as first_program in a convenient directory, taking care to
      select MATLAB Files (*.m) under File Type. Under the File menu, we select
      Open, and find first_program.m. This reopens the editor (so we could have
      skipped closing it earlier). We run our program by hitting f5 or selecting Run
      under the Debug menu. In the Command Window, we see our greeting;
      MATLAB is waiting for a keyboard response, so just hit the Enter key.
          Let’s expand a previous example to allow the magnitude to be user-
      selected as in Fig. A6.4. We are now allowed to enter an arbitrary amplitude
      for our plot.




      ■ FIGURE A6.4 Example m-file named example1.m for
        generating sine wave plot.

        We leave it to the reader to choose when to write a program/m-file and
      when to simply use the Command Window directly.

ADDITIONAL LAPLACE
TRANSFORM THEOREMS

In this appendix, we briefly present several Laplace transform theorems
typically used in more advanced situations in addition to those described in
Chap. 14.


Transforms of Periodic Time Functions
The time-shift theorem is very useful in evaluating the transform of periodic
time functions. Suppose that f (t) is periodic with a period T for positive
values of t. The behavior of f (t) for t < 0 has no effect on the (one-sided)
Laplace transform, as we know. Thus, f (t) can be written as
                    f (t) = f (t − nT )         n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
If we now define a new time function which is nonzero only in the first
period of f (t),
                        f 1 (t) = [u(t) − u(t − T )] f (t)
then the original f (t) can be represented as the sum of an infinite number of
such functions, delayed by integral multiples of T . That is,

        f (t) = [u(t) − u(t − T )] f (t) + [u(t − T ) − u(t − 2T )] f (t)
                 + [u(t − 2T ) − u(t − 3T )] f (t) + · · ·
              = f 1 (t) + f 1 (t − T ) + f 1 (t − 2T ) + · · ·

or
                                      
                                      ∞
                            f (t) =         f 1 (t − nT )
                                      n=0

     The Laplace transform of this sum is just the sum of the transforms,
                                   
                                   ∞
                          F(s) =         { f 1 (t − nT )}
                                   n=0

so that the time-shift theorem leads to
                                      
                                      ∞
                            F(s) =          e−nT s F1 (s)
                                      n=0

where
                                                T
                     F1 (s) = { f 1 (t)} =          e−st f (t) dt
                                                0−

                                                                                                833
834   APPENDIX 7 ADDITIONAL LAPLACE TRANSFORM THEOREMS


      Since F1 (s) is not a function of n, it can be removed from the summation,
      and F(s) becomes
                              F(s) = F1 (s)[1 + e−T s + e−2T s + · · ·]

      When we apply the binomial theorem to the bracketed expression, it sim-
      plifies to 1/(1 − e−T s ). Thus, we conclude that the periodic function f (t),
      with period T, has a Laplace transform expressed by
                                                         F1 (s)
                                             F(s) =                               [1]
                                                       1 − e−T s

      where
                                F1 (s) = {[u(t) − u(t − T )] f (t)}              [2]
      is the transform of the first period of the time function.
          To illustrate the use of this transform theorem for periodic functions, let
      us apply it to the familiar rectangular pulse train, Fig. A7.1. We may de-
      scribe this periodic function analytically:
                              
                              ∞

      ■ FIGURE A7.1 A periodic train of rectangular pulses
        for which F(s) = (V 0 /s)(1 − e −sτ )/(1 − e −sT ) .




      The function V1 (s) is simple to calculate:
                                     τ
                                                   V0
                       V1 (s) = V0       e−st dt =    (1 − e−sτ )
                                      0−           s

      Now, to obtain the desired transform, we just divide by (1 − e−sT ):
                                                     V0 (1 − e−sτ )
                                           V(s) =                                 [3]
                                                     s(1 − e−sT )

      We should note how several different theorems show up in the transform in
      Eq. [3]. The (1 − e−sT ) factor in the denominator accounts for the periodic-
      ity of the function, the e−sτ term in the numerator arises from the time de-

 We begin by writing an equation which describes f (t), a function
 composed of alternating positive and negative impulse functions.
            f (t) = 2δ(t − 1) − 2δ(t − 3) + 2δ(t − 5) − 2δ(t − 7) + · · ·                               (2)                   (2)

 There are several ways to evaluate this integral. The easiest is to
 recognize that its value will remain the same if the upper limit is
 increased to ∞, allowing us to make use of the time-shift theorem.
 Thus,
                                      F1 (s) = 2[e−s − e−3s ]                         [5]

Frequency Shifting
The next new theorem establishes a relationship between F(s) = { f (t)}
and F(s + a). We consider the Laplace transform of e−at f (t),
                        ∞                     ∞
            −at              −st −at
        {e f (t)} =        e e f (t) dt =        e−(s+a)t f (t) dt
                                     0−                         0−

Looking carefully at this result, we note that the integral on the right is iden-
tical to that defining F(s) with one exception: (s + a) appears in place of s.
Thus,
                                       e−at f (t) ⇔ F(s + a)                           [6]
836   APPENDIX 7 ADDITIONAL LAPLACE TRANSFORM THEOREMS


      We conclude that replacing s by (s + a) in the frequency domain corresponds
      to multiplication by e−at in the time domain. This is known as the frequency-
      shift theorem. It can be put to immediate use in evaluating the transform of
      the exponentially damped cosine function that we used extensively in previ-
      ous work. Beginning with the known transform of the cosine function,
                                                              s

                                                       s2 + ω02
      then the transform of e−at cos ω0 t must be F(s + a):
                                                              s+a

      Next let us examine the consequences of differentiating F(s) with respect to

      which is simply the Laplace transform of [−t f (t)]. We therefore conclude
      that differentiation with respect to s in the frequency domain results in mul-
      tiplication by −t in the time domain, or

      The Time-Scaling Theorem
      We next develop the time-scaling theorem of Laplace transform theory by
      evaluating the transform of f (at), assuming that { f (t)} is known. The
      procedure is very simple:
                             ∞                   
                                                 1 ∞ −(s/a)λ
               { f (at)} =     e−st f (at) dt =       e       f (λ) dλ
                             0−                  a 0−
      where the change of variable at = λ has been employed. The last integral is
      recognizable as 1/a times the Laplace transform of f (t), except that s is re-
      placed by s/a in the transform. It follows that
                                               1   s
                                    f (at) ⇔     F                             [14]

      As an elementary example of the use of this time-scaling theorem, consider
      the determination of the transform of a 1 kHz cosine wave. Assuming we
      know the transform of a 1 rad/s cosine wave,
                                                     s
